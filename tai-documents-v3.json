Kittens are a good pet because they love to play with you. Kittens are a good pet because they love to play with you because reason 1. Be responsible of your pet. Reason 2. keep your pet feed. And most of all reason 3. They sleep with you.\r\n\r\n\tOne reason that kittens are a good pet because they play with you is that be responsible of your pet. For example in the text What does Your New kitten Needs says \"when bringing a kitten into your home its best when you are prepared\" Another example in the text What does Your New Kitten Need says that \"when your hitting the road you'll need a carrier\" Finally in the text it says \"your kitten has lots of energy so select bowls that can't tip over\".\r\n\r\n\tReason 2 kittens are a good pet because they play with you is that keep your pet feed because they love to play. For example in the text What Does Your New Kitten Need says that \"make sure the box is roomy to prevent scatters litter around the house\" because you feed your cat and you don't want poop on the floor. Another example is when you feed your cat make sure you do not feed your cat do not wear your nice clothing,it will not look too good. Finally when you feed your cat make sure you have something to keep the food from getting on your clothing.\r\n\r\n\tReason 3. Although kittens are a good pet because they love to play because be responsible of your pet and because to keep your pet feed because of they sleep with you. For example when it's time for bed they love to come follow you to your room. Another example is when they are ready for bed they love to go to the end of the bed for when the love to sleep with you. Finally you can say to your cat that it's time for bed and than you pick them up and go to your room.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\tIn conclusion kittens are a good pet because they love to play because be responsible of your pet, and keep your pet feed and most of all, because they sleep with you I think you should get a kitten because they are a good pet to love you.

Wolfs have been around for decades changing how they are since the beginning. From what animals they feast on, what they do in the pack to help out, and how the wolfs grow up. The gray wolf is a unique creature\r\n\r\nWhat They Feast on\r\n\r\n\tThe gray wolf tends to eat larger animals such as deer or elk mostly whatever large animal they can get a hold of. One singular full grown wolf can consume up to 20 pounds of food. Because of this, they have to hunt a lot especially if they are in a pack and they have to feed everyone. But they don\u2019t just have to eat large animals they can also consume smaller creatures such as birds, fish, fruit, and more.\r\n\r\nHow they Help the Pack\r\n\r\n\tMost of the time the gray wolf will be in a pack of a couple of other wolves. The leader of the pack is usually the mom and dad or known as the alphas. The alphas are the ones who go hunting for the pack and choose den sites and more, they are the heavyweight lifters of the pack. The Wolves also have many different ways to communicate with each other. One way is by howling to signal that they might be in danger or in trouble. Another way would be through body language, for instants if a wolf feels threatened it will growl and get into a sort of fighting stance.\r\n\r\nLife Growing up as a Wolf\r\n\r\n\tWhen the grey wolf is born it\u2019s born defenseless against other predators this leads the mother to be with her baby every day. While this happens other wolfs help collect food and other stuff the mother needs. The wolfs play a lot when growing up it almost acts like how a normal kid would act. When the baby is grown enough to hunt it goes into the wild to live on its own.\r\n\r\n\tAll in all the grey wolf is a marvelous creature from what animals it eats, to how they contribute to the pack, and life growing up as a wolf.

Also it is accessible for VR such as vive VR and Oculus VR. also this gaming PC doesn't just run good it also looks how a gaming PC should look like. my favorite thing is that instead of plastic on

On-Demand\n\nSoccer!\n\nIntrodcution\n\tDo you know how to play soccer? Cause it's an awesome sport to play and i'll teach you. I'm going to teach you about the rules, positions and playing the real game of soccer.\n\nRules!\n\tFirst of all rules are very important in soccer. Here some rules that are in soccer, you can header the ball some seasons or you can drop kick the ball something. When your playing you can't hit the ball out of bounds or the other team gets to throw the ball in. Another rule is no hands only feet.\n\nPositions\n\tTo continure, here are the positions.  There are many positions like goalie or defence, there is one person in the goal and three people playing defence.  Two other positions are midfield or forward, there is two to three people playing mid field and three playing forward.\n\nPLaying the real game!\n\tTo move on, here's how to play with rules and positions.  The people playing forward kick the ball back to the midfielders and move up the fiels and defence falls back if the other team gets the ball and run torward the goal.  And if the goalie catches it and throws or jacks it up the field then the forwards or midfielders go make a goal and if they make it they get a point and the team with the most points win.  After the practive games there's playoffs.\n\nConclusion\n\n\tAll in all, soccer is a fun game to play.  If you ever play soccer you can look back at this paper and remember the rules, the positions and playing the real game of  soccer!  Now go ahead and play SOCCER!!! Plus you can play whenever and where ever!", "doctitle": "02_Patolia_03", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 28.0, "average": 2.33, "criteria": {"overall": 2.5, "lead": 2.5, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.0, "craft": 2.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 3.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "Try to hook me more", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "Write more about each topic to prove you are an expert.", "craft": "Use a teaching tone", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 95, "end_index": 100, "old_text": "Cause", "new_text": null, "type": "spelling", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 135, "end_index": 139, "old_text": "i'll", "new_text": null, "type": "spelling", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 643, "end_index": 645, "old_text": ", ", "new_text": ".", "type": "punctuation", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 645, "end_index": 650, "old_text": "there", "new_text": null, "type": "spelling", "comment": ""}], "checkboxes": {"checked": ["2-0_overall", "3-0_overall", "4-0_overall", "4-1_overall", "2-0_lead", "3-0_lead", "4-1_lead", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_transitions", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_transitions", "2-0_ending", "3-0_ending", "4-0_ending", "4-1_ending", "2-0_organization", "3-0_organization", "3-1_organization", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_organization", "4-1_organization", "4-2_organization", "2-0_elaboration", "3-0_elaboration", "4-0_elaboration", "4-1_elaboration", "2-0_craft", "3-0_craft", "3-1_craft", "0-1_spelling", "0-1_punctuation", "0-6_punctuation", "0-1_grammar", "0-7_grammar"], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "4-0_craft", "4-0_lead", "4-1_craft", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}]}, {"id": 36, "plaintext": "Fed. 27, 2019\nInfo. On-Demand\nHow to do an Aerial\n\nIntroduction\n\n\tDid you know Aerials are no handed cartwheels? In this essay, you will learn how to get Started, The Approach, and Drills.  So go get a soft mat and read on to find out how to do an Aerial.\n\nStarting\n\nThe first thing you will do when you're doing gymnastics, or the Ariel, is stretch. You can stretch your ankles, wrists, back, and shoulders.  If you are trying a Aerial, then you should have a solid cartwheel.  If you don;t, then you should not try the Aerial just ye.  (work on a cartwheel first. )  When you finished stretching and doing some cartwheels, then be ready to work on Aerials.\n\nThe Approach\n\tThe first thing in attempting an Aerial is to do a dive cartwheel.  It's basically a cartwheel but you jump to your hands and then finish the cartwheel normally.  After you've mastered the dive cartwheel, you can try a pop cartwheel.  It's when you do a cartwheel but when your hands hit the ground, you take them of the ground.  Once you've mastered the pop cartwheel.  It's when you do a cartwheel but when your hands hit the ground, you take them of the ground.  Once you've mastered the pop cartwheel, you should practive your takeoff in the Aerial.  You will do a hertel and lean forward and kick your leg up.  You could also do this against a wall.  After you/ve mastered all of those steps, you can ask someone strong enough to spot you in the Aerial. They can spot you a lot in the beginning and then barely spot you when you feel comfortable.  Then you can try it on your own.\n\nDrills\n\tSome drills you could try to help you get closer to and Aerial is if you have access to a trampoline, then you could try jumping and kicking your feet together and do and Aerial because doing the Aerial on a trampoline you could hurt yourself if you do a ground Aerial.  Another drill is that you could practice the dive and pop cartwheel together and do a bunch of those and it will help you get closer.  You could also do handstand hops.  They are when you go into a handstand and when your hands touch ground, you hop.  Those will help you will the pop cartwheel.\n\nConclusion\n\tAll in all, I hop you got your Aerial.

Welcome to the world of the periodic table.  Look around, everything you see is made up of a compound.  For example, how water is formed and how the atoms connect.  There are 118 elements in the periodic table!  Some elements are metals, some are gasses, some are liquids, and some are both!  Did you know that 5,000,000,000,000,000 atoms can fit in the eye of a needle?  What are atoms made of and what are their benefits?  All of these questions you've been holding are \n\nis hard to get separated.  But the graphite's molecules are separated.  They are not so close together.  Consequently, it is easily broken.\n\nThe Periodic Table\n\n\tThere are many different kinds of elements.  Some natural, some artificial.  Some are metals, some are gasses, and some are unknown!  Most of the items in the periodic table are metal.  Some fo the metals include; gold which many of you have heard, mercury, copper, lead, titanium (the strongest useful metal), iron, tungsten, lithium, and many other.  There are 91 in all.  Furthermore, the nonmetals are hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, selenium, hydrogen, and some others.

This means that they aren't made up of anything, they were just there.  Now, you know that that doesn't make sense.  So how where they created?  Maybe a bit later that mystery will be solved.  Harry Gee Cardiff says, \"Some theorists suggested quarks might themselves contain particles known as 'preons'.\"\n\nThis world world is made out of teeny tiny particles.  Now you know the structure and how the atoms come together.  There are many elements in the periodic table.  Atoms are made of several things and are beneficial.  Many problems are solved with this information.

Well I can tell you about a type of wolves and that is the Grey Wolves. First, we will learn about what Grey Wolves look like. Then, we will learn about how Grey Wolves Hunt. Finally, we will learn about what Grey Wolves eat. Did you know that Grey Wolves are the biggest dogs of the dog family? I think that after reading this book you will want to tell everyone about what you learned. Now off we go to learn about Grey Wolves!\n\nWhat do they look like?\nHave you ever wondered what Gray Wolves look like? Well , the Males are always larger than the females. Grey Wolves have silvery grey-brown backs. They also have light tan and creamy underparts. Their tail is bushy as a squarrils tail. Their fur can be any shade of grey, brown, black, white, or tan. In the winter a Grey Wolf;s fur is darker on the neck, shoulders, and rump. Well, we just learned about what Grey Wolves look like. Now onto the next topic!\n\nHunting\nHmm, I wonder how Grey Wolves hunt. Oh! Wait a second, I do know how they hunt. For hunting Grey Wolves respond to the signals they take turns chasing the prey to tire it out. Or they would chase it into a ambush. An ambush is a trap. I am telling you this because I want to make sure that you know what I am saying. But once they are done chasing the prey they kill and eat it. Wow, that is a really interesting and amazing way to hunt! On to the next topic!\n\nPrey\nDid you know that Grey Wolves eat many things big and small? First, we are going to talk about the big things that Grey Wolves eat. The smallest of the big thing are the mountain goat and the deer. The regular big things are the Elk, Moose, and Bison. Now we are going to talk about the small things that Grey Wolves eat. The small things that they eat is beavers and hares. They also eat birds and fish. I think that what Grey Wolves eat is really fascinating. \n\nConclusion\nWow! We just learned about what Grey Wolves look like, how they hunt, and what they eat. Do you think that Grey Wolves are your favorite type of wolves? I think that Grey Wolves may be my favorite wolves ever. I really hope that you think that Grey Wolves are interesting. You should tell your friends all about them. But there is still many things that you need to learn about Grey Wolves. But that is all I will tell you!

The Terracotta Army!  The Terracotta army are life sized figures made out of a type of clay called terracotta.  They were built by the emperor of China, thought to be cursed, and is visited by one millino tourists each year.\n\nThe Orcer of the Emperor\n\nThe Terracotta Warriors were built by Qin Shi Huang, the emperor of China.  He believed in eternal life.  He told his slaves to build a terracotta replica of his army.  He died in 210 BC of mercury poisoning and was buried with the replica. It took the slaces an estimated 40 years to build it.  Each figure was different from the other.  They ended up building about 8,000 of them, and they were all put in a special order.  There were soldiers, horses, and chariots. Weapons were added later.\n\nThe Curse of the Terracotta Army\n\nThe clay figures have been untouched for more than 2,000 years, until in 1974, seven chinese farmers discovered it while digging.  Shortly after that, three of them caught disease, or died early deaths.  From then on, people believed that the clay warriors were cursed.  It was thought the clay army was more of a curse than a blessing.  This one reason how it fascinated many tourists each year.  The remaining four farmers were even asked to sit in the gift shop to sign signatures!\n\nChina's Famous Attraction\n\nnow the Terracotta Army is one the most famous attraction in China.  It has over one million tourists each year!  These is actually a place in the gift shop where you can take a picture of you standing in from of a replica of the clay army.  You can also buy small terracotta warriors made form real terracotta.  Another cool thing there is that you can get a book signed by one of the few farmers that discovered the terracotta army!\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the terracotta army was built by the emperor of China, once thought to be cursed, and is one of the most famous attractions in China.  Someday you should definitely visit this wonder.

Did you know that gymnastics was made in 1881 that was about 4,000 years ago. I'm going to teach you about, Who created gymnastics, Why gymnastics was made, The events of gymnastics, The differents levels of gymnastics, and competition.\n\nWho made gymnastics\nFriedrich Ludwig Jahn was the creator of gymnastics. He was born on August 11, 1778 and died on October 15, 1852. He died when he was 74, so he basically lived a fool life. He went to the University of Greifswald he went there to study theology and philology. He was born in Lanz Brandenburg, Prussia. He did not have a family.\n\nWhy was gymnastics created\nGymnastics was made so people can be active, have fun, and learn how to do skills.  Gymnastics was made was made because, after a war  Friedrich country's amy , he came up with a idea so he started to work. Until he came up with all the events for gymnastics.\n\nAll the events in gymnastics\nThere are events in gymnastics there are, Uneven Bars, Beam, Vault, and Floor, Rings, Parallel bars, Pommel horse, and Horizontal Bar, Women and Men usually do different events. Like the boys do, Floor, rings, parallel bars, horizontal bars, pommel horse, vault. They do different things like at my gymnastics the boys practice a lot at all their different events.\n\nThe different levels in gymnastics\nThere are ten different levels in gymnastisc there is, level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, and level 10.  Level 10 is the highest level there is in gymnastics, they also do the hardest things, for example, they do double backflips, front twist, back twist, and double front flips.  In all the levels you do different things. For example level 1 is the first level there is, level 1 you are just learning the basics.\n\nCompetition\nIn gymnastics you have to go to competition if you in a level, but if you are not in a level then you don't have to go to competition. Competition can be hard, but sometimes it can be easy. It;s hard because there are other teams from different gymnastics, it makes it hard because you are all competing against each other first place of second place, nobody really wants third place.\n\nConclusion\nNow that you know about gymnastics maybe you would consider trying it out. I taught you about , Who made gymnastics was created, All the events in gymnastics, All of the levels in gymnastics, and Competition.\n\n2nd floor(216)\nstairs\nwhere everyone else is walking",

If you try to do your best and cheet own your teammates for sure you will win.  Baseball takes a lot of teamwork and practice because you need to work with your teammates., to win you need to cooperate with your teammates, and most of all, because you need to cheer them on.\n\tOne reason that baseball takes a lot of teamwork and practice is to win you have to cooperate with your teammates.  For example in my baseball team we work together and help each other out.  Aditionally in our first game we are losing but then we worked it out and helped each other out.  Additionally in out first game we were losing but then we worked it out and helped each other out and we caught up to the other team and then we won.  Finally you have to trust each other and help them as much as you can and if you do you can win.\n\tAnother reason that baseball takes a lot of teamwork is that you have to help each other out. For example in our game my teammate missed catching the game and I got the ball and helped him out. Additionally in practice my teammate couldn't hit a single ball and I helped him out and he hit plenty of baseballs.  Finally you have to trust each other and help them as much as you can.\n\tAlthough baseball takes a lot of of teamwork because to win you need teamwork, and because you have to help each other out because you have to cheer them on.  For example in our game my teammate was going to strike out but then we started chanting, You can do this and he hit it very hard and far.  Another reason is in practice my teammate was sad because he didn't catch a ball and we cheered for him and he finally caught it.  Finally in our game we were losing but then we started cheering for our team and we caught up and passed them and we won.\n\tIn conclusion baseball takes a lot of teamwork because to win you need teamwork, you have to help each other out, and most of all you have to cheer them on.

For example we have only gotten to change backrounds two times.\n\nIn conclusion I realise it\u2019s good to have a little bit of computer time bbut it\u2019s better to have an hour because we only get 30 minutes a week, we should be able to do other things not just ST Math, and most of all we should have time to change backrounds.", "doctitle": "07_Rice_10", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 26.0, "average": 2.17, "criteria": {"overall": 2.5, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 2.0, "ending": 2.5, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.0, "craft": 2.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}]}, {"id": 49, "plaintext": "La purisima mission\r\nEmily Theresi #27\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n1.\tIntroduction\r\n2.\tThe rooms\r\n3.\tLife at the mission\r\n4.\tThe spanish and the native americans\r\n5.\tConclusion\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nWelcome to la purisima !

Universe is expanding right now , Do you know how a Black hole forms , Do you know how a star forms , Do you know how to travel forward in time \u2026\n\nDid you know how the Universe is expanding right now ?\nEveryone in World knows light is the fast thing in the Universe but many people don\u2019t know how far can travel in one sd they say light travels at 1,000 km per sd or more . If you don\u2019t exactly how far can light travel in one sd ,it travels. \nThe speed of light in a vacuum is 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second). \u201cYou might have notices this p talks different then the heading \u201d\nMabe light travels very fast ,but the Universe is very very big that million of years to go out of the Universe.\nWhen light travels through the Universe it  expands and the space around it also expands . After that the Universe  expands forever\u2026\n\nDo you know how a Black hole forms?\nImagine a room of a lot lottery not one shirt will fit in the room, if you try it really hard it will turn into Black hole .There are one ways a Black hole can form . The First way is a really massive star burn really hot and fast . When this progress starts in the stars core there will a little bit iron , it builds up in the core. When the  the iron is big enough the star dies in a progress called Supernova. The leftover of the star is the  iron it become a Black hole\u2026\n\nDo you know hoe a star forms?\nA star form When a lot of hydrogen gas cloud are near to each other . When they are near to each other gravity puts them at high pursue and a star forms. \nDo you know that in some ways star can form inside a star ?The First way is ,a really massive star burn really hot and fast . When this progress starts in the stars core there will a little bit iron ,it builds up in the core. When the  the iron is big enough the star dies in a progress called Supernova . The leftover of the star is the iron it becomes a Black hole or a Neutron star .These is how star con form inside a star\u2026\n\nDo you know how to travel forward in time?\nAs you approach the speed of light, your clock runs so slow you could come back 10,000 years in the future.\u2019 The theory is based on Einstein\u2019s Theory of Special Relativity that states to travel forward in time, an object would need to reach speeds close to the speed of light. These p says if you need to travel forward in time close to speed of light \u2026.\n\nConclusion\nIn my book, I thought you about some of the special things in Universe.And again my subtopics are  Did you know how the  Universe is expanding right now , Do you know how a Black hole forms , Do you know how a star forms , Do you know how to travel forward in time .

Well today I am going to show you all the bikes that I know about.For my first reason I am going to be talking about different types of bikes. The first bike I am going to be talking about is a Mountain bike. One of the really good reasons you should use a mountain bike is they go on mountains and do tricks. Also they have really grippy tires. The next bike I am going to be talking about is BMX bikes. One really good reason about this bike is it can do many tricks like a Fable Grind. The last bike I am going to be talking about is an Electric bike. One really good reason about the electric bike is it can move by itself if you spin the bars. Also if you pedal you give the electric motor energy.\r\n\r\nGear\r\n\r\nHave  you ever wondered what you need to be safe well I will tell you right now! The first thing that you need is a helmet.

(And by the way a shih tzu is a type of dog if you didn\u2019t already know that). Shih tzus are animals that you can talk to and think of as a friend. Today I\u2019ll be telling you about what shih tzus eat, and how they act, and what you need to take care of them. \n\nMost shih tzus eat grain free food. Sometimes you make your dog food for example, turkey, chicken, and sliced up carrots. When you buy your dog food you can test some out to see if they like the food. Shih tzu\u2019s are very picky dogs and they take a while to find the right food for them. If you have two shih tzu\u2019s most often they like different things so you might have to test out a few different food for them. They like vegetables. (They can\u2019t have fruit because of the seeds). Well now you know what they like to eat.\n\nShih tzus are very active and like to play a lot. But rarely they like to sleep because they\u2019re too busy playing. But when they do sleep they like to snuggle but in the morning they go right back to being mischievous and playful. For example sometimes they will take things and destroy them (latter you will forgive them\u2026 someday). But they\u2019re also very loving dogs. If you don\u2019t play with them they will get a little mad and start to bark but they are very sweet most of the time. Shih tzus are also very smart. But shih tzu\u2019s also think they are the king/queen of the world so they can\u2019t be that smart.\n\nFrist what you need to take care of a shih tzu is food, water, a leash, a dog bed, and you have to be very patient. You also have to be willing to play all the time. And go for walks all the time. Also you need to have a lot of free time or have kids so that they can play with the dog because shih tzus have a lot of energy.\n\nNow you know you are an expert on what shih tzus eat, how they act, and what you need to take care of them.

can\u2019t afford a RC car and RC cars are a lot of money To pay for from the drones are less money if you are a RC cars then if you haven\u2019t seen a drone then maybe We\u2019ll be less money and RC car but maybe it will be more money than arms me car because something Minutes or less active to go in the sky and if you haven\u2019t ever seen all morning or another you wouldn\u2019t know How to

Well if not then the hotter or bigger sun is KELT-9b this plant is hotter than most stars it was found in the year 2016. Did you know that no one knows how old saturn\u2019s rings are? Do you know that venus is named after the goddess of love? Her name was Venus too!\n\nDifferent planets\n\nHave you heard of mars? Well mars is planet that most people think it does not have any life in it. But mars could support life. Which is really cool if you think about it. Now let\u2019s not forget about saturn here. Saturn has 62 moons! I bet you didn\u2019t know about that, and now jupiter, did you know the great red spot on jupiter has been around for a long time! Jupiter is also the fastest spinning planet in are solar system.\n\nSun\n\nDid you know that the sun will one day eat the earth? Kinda scary right? Well to begin the sun is made out of leftover gas\u2019s from the nebula. But did you know that the sun is almost a perfect sphere? Also the sun is SO big that it can fit over one million earths inside the sun. Did you know that sun the is travling over 220 km per second? The sun is huge but tiny. The sun is also the solar system!\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope you liked learning about space. Like the fun facts about space, different planets, and our bright sun. Who knows you might be an astronaut and go out of our milky way to see other places around in space. Or even find new life forms like us humans. You don\u2019t know what can be out there in space so if you do want to do those things then I suggest you to be careful.", "doctitle": "05_Campanile_3", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "",

The shot is good. Buckets, The warriors win 99-98. This is basketball. You will learn what gear you need for basketball, where to play basketball and very famous basketball players and really good teams.\n\nYou need a lot of gear to play basketball. For example, you need special shoes for basketball because if you wear regular shows they get ruined because you run a lot in basketball and the bottoms get worn out. You don\u2019t have to wear basketball shoes if you are just shooting, but in a game you should wear basketball shoes. You also need a basketball. There is a kid size basketball and a professional size. You also need basketball hoops to shoot in. One time I was play basketball in my reguer shoes and when the game was over, the bottoms were practically worn off. \n\nYou need a place to play basketball. You can practically play basketball anywhere as long as you have a hoop to shoot in. The best place to play is inside on a wood floor because a wood floor is better for basketball. Also if it\u2019s raining you don\u2019t want to be outside playing basketball, right? In the summer though its nice out so you should play outside. So the best place to play when its raining is inside.\n\nThere are alot of famous basketball players and good teams. Michael jordan was a really good basketball player that played on the bulls. Kobe bryant played on the lakers. Shaquille o\u2019neal also played on the lakers. bryant and o\u2019neal were teammates. Stephen curry is also a really good player on the golden state warriors. Lebron James is really good player on the lakers. Really good teams are the LA lakers the warriors the raptors the bulls and the oakland thunder.\n\nIt\u2019s a rematch between the warriors and the lakers. The warriors were winning 102-101. With 10 seconds left lebron james dribbles down the. Stephen curry was playing really good defense when hames does a crossover and jukes out curry takes two step and dunks it!

do you know about Mother Nature? Did know that some incredible plants can grow six feet in one day?! Prepare yourself for an amazing opportunity to learn about where these crazy plants live, how they\u2019ve adapted to their environment, and world records! (The fastest growing, most poisonous, and the stinkiest.) Be sure to take a look at the diagram at the back of the book.  Expand your brain for exciting new knowledge!\r\n\r\nWhere They Live\r\n\r\n\tI will now be telling you where an amazing plants live, and why it needs their environment.\r\n\tNear a stream of crystal water, in the middle of Africa, a small plant with fur like fuzz is thriving in the hot sun. Although this plant looks quite fun to touch, you probably shouldn\u2019t! This fantastic plant is known as the stinging nettle. First of all, the stinging nettle can be located in United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. No matter what, this plant needs the sun, but will usually be found by a stream or river so it can have some moisture, They also need ways to get nutrients, so they must consume the animal carcasses that decompose near where they live. You might also be wondering how it got its name. This is how: whenever the stinging nettle comes in contact with skin or light fur, (like a horse), it is known to send off a burning and itching sensation. And that\u2019s why this plant is known as the stinging nettle!\r\n\r\nHow They\u2019ve Adapted\r\n\r\nWhy are some plants able to survive harsh conditions? How do they live in boiling, hot deserts r below freezing temperatures? Let\u2019s find out!\r\n\tIn a large, rocky desert in Mexico, a small cactus stands, staring p into the golden sun. Wouldn\u2019t it die? You\u2019d be surprised! This little plant is known as the hedgehog cactus, and it is hard to kill! Hedgehog cacti can be found Southwest including New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Although these plants are mostly found in the desert, they can also survive freezing conditions. Additionally, these florae can live in boiling temperature on account that they are succulents. Succulents are an interesting plant to know about because they have a supply of water inside their leaves, stem, and roots. Some succulents you may be familiar with are jave, echeveria elegans, fasicated hawthoria, and hawthoria retusa. You can tell if a plant is a succulent or not from breaking open the leaf or stem. If there is water inside, it is a succulent. That is one of the many ways plants survive their habitat.\r\n\r\nWorld Records\r\n\r\n\tSome plants can smell like dirty diapers, moldy cheese, and rotten eggs, while others can grow 3-6 feet in one day! Wow! Are you ready to become an expert on plants that live in extremes?\r\n\tA lemur jumps to the forest floor of the Amazon rainforest. It looks around for something to eat, when it spots a small, shiny red seed. It crawls over to the seed, but the quickly darts away. The lemur knows this plant is dangerous. This deadly plant is known as the castor bean. Filled with one of the most crucial poisons, ricin, a small dose can kill a person. However the bright colors of a castor bean are to warn animals, \u201cDon\u2019t eat me!!!\u201d.\r\nA beautiful rainforest in Indonesia is home to a huge flower. This plant has been waiting to bloom for 7-10 years! Unfortunately, once the flower opens, it releases an odor smelling of dirty diapers, rotten eggs, and moldy cheese! This big stinker is called the corpse flower. As you now know, it has a putrid smell. It may smell absolutely terrible to you, but to pollinators, this smell is saying, \u201cCome pollinate me, I\u2019m food!\u201d With it\u2019s horrible odor, the corpse flower lures bugs, such as flies and mosquitoes, to pollinate it. The corpse flower is only open for 24 hours, and then it is forced to close.\r\nIn the forests of Taiwan, a small bamboo stalk stands about 3 feet. But by the end of the day, once the sun sets, it will be 5-6 feet tall! This rising giant is known as the tortoise-shell bamboo, and boy, does it grow! Many people around the world are interested in this plant. At a growth rate of 4 centimeters every hour, you can see it grow with your own eyes! Bamboo plants are a very interesting, because these plants don\u2019t grow new cells. They just get bigger, allowing the bamboo stalks to grow taller. This world record breaks others!\r\n\r\nDiagram\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy these two diagrams. One of a flower, and the other is just a plant.\r\n\r\nGoodbye!\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed learning about these plants that live in the extremes. As you can see, plants are incredible creatures that do a lot to survive. Many of them are not extreme, but they do a lot to help the earth. And who knows?

There are some very interesting and rare deep sea predators. Some animals are even bioluminescent. Also some animals can live in the deepest part of the sea!\n\nPredators of the deep sea\nFirst of all, what predators live in the deep sea? Some of the interesting predators that live in the deep sea are the Vampire squid, Pelican eel, Fangtooth, Giant isopod, and Goblin shark. Some rare deep sea predators are Frilled Shark, and Pacific Viperfish. Predators are important to the deep sea because if there weren\u2019t deep see predators there would be to much pray, and it\u2019s bad if there is to much pray because they will eat all the plants and then there won\u2019t be enough for all the pray to eat. So the pray will start dying off. Also some deep sea animals use bioluminescence to survive.\n\nBioluminiscent deep sea animals\nFurthermore, bioluminescence helps animals survive the deep sea. It helps them because the deep sea is very dark and with bioluminescence the animals could not see which they could not hunt as well or if they are pray and they are bioluminescent it warns predators that they contain toxins in there boty, and that makes predators not able to eat them.\n\nSome animals live in the deepest parts of the sea\nIn addition, animals can survive the deepest parts of the sea. You\u2019re probably wondering how do the animals survive the pressure of the water? \u201cTo avoid the problem of pressure, many animals that live very deep in the ocean do not have any air spaces inside their bodies (e.g. the fish have oil-filled swim bladders or no swim bladders at all). This means the crushing pressure really doesn\u2019t affect them.\u201dscienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=685. The deep sea begins at 200 meters below the ocean\u2019s surface. Deep sea animals can amazingly survive the extreme pressure, but the animals can also survive the extreme cold water temper, the tempicher is 5 or below degrees Celsius.\n\tIn conclusion, predators, bioluminescent animals, and animals living in the deepest part of the sea are all part of the deep sea. If you like these amazing deep sea cricurs you can look up lots of things about them, and maybe even find something you can do to help them.\n\nGlossary\nBioloononesent: The emission of light by living organisms, such as fireflies, glowworms, and certain fish, jellyfish, plankton, fungi, and bacteria. It occurs when a pigment (usually luciferin) is oxidized without giving off heat. Although it is believed that bioluminescence is involved in animal communication, it\u2019s function in many organisms has yet to be understood. Bioluminescence is a form if chemiluminescence.

You are going to learn what your body movements should be like, you are going to learn about the sounds you should make at the right times, and you are going to learn the face expressions you should make at the right times.  You are going to learn how to act.\n\nIf you are going to want to act, you need to know what your body movements should be like.  For example, if you are going to pretend to be scared, you are going to want to step back and look right at the thing you are scared of and have wide eyes.  For example, one time I was in an acting class and I just pretended that I was actually where I was pretending to be.  Also, when you are pretending to be very engaged in a conversation, you might want to take a step forward if you are telling a lot of useful things.  If you are pretending to be talking to someone and you are kind of scared of them then you stay away from them.  Remember to act like like you are actually where you are pretending to be.\n\nYou also need to make sounds when you are acting.  When you are acting you should use a high pitched voice sometimes when you want to or already are screaming.  You should also sometimes use a high pitched voice when you are pretending to be scared.  If you are pretending to be scared you should use quiet air from your lungs to make a whimpering scared noise.  You need to use a low pitched voice when you are pretending to be mad or very firm and confident.  You could also use a low pitched voice sometimes when you are pretending to give someone an insult.\n\nOf course, if you are going to act you will want to know what face expressions you need to make at the right times.  For example, if you are scared you should have wide eyes and a face that looks nervous.  If you are pretending to be nervous because of someone, but you want to pretend that you pretending to be happy but you are actually nervous you should show a half smile and look down every once in awhile.  One time I was in an acting class and I pretended to be scared of someone so I had wide eyes to make myself look scared.  Also, when you are pretending to be keeping a secret and someone is talking about something you lied about and they don\u2019t know you did you should just keep your mouth closed and look down just a little and don\u2019t really acknowledge what the person is saying and just stand there.

hear \u201cInsect?\u201d  Eww, right?  This is going to change eww to ooh!  There are beetles and bees.  They eat a variety of food.  Some even go through a metamorphosis.  And you\u2019ll learn where some live.  Now, get read-y, get set, and LET\u2019S BUT OUT!\n\nSpecies\nTo start, in total, there are about 350,000 kinds of insects.  There are Ladybugs, Rhinoceros beetles, and a whole bunch of others.  Here\u2019s a link to look at some different types: https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-beetles-2072991  Anyways, beetles are big and small.  The smallest beetles are called feather-winged beetles.  Their size is about 0.25 mm!  Crazy, right?  One of the biggest beetles is the giant long-horned beetle with a length of 16-21 CM!\n\nSome kinds of beetles, since there are so many, just eat every kind of food.  The others feed on things like plants, dead or alive, other insects, some scavenge, and some even eat your own blood!\n\nNext is bees.  Bees are in a group called pollinators.  Pollinators don\u2019t only feed on nectar.  They get pollen stuck on their legs and spread it.  This helps things grow.  When you see a beehive, you mainly just run away because you don\u2019t want to bee stung.  Well, you may also run away from 1 bee.  But, have you ever wondered the bees do?  Queen: The queen is the leader.  She lays the eggs and runs the whole hive.  DON\u2019T COMPLAIN MOMS!  Workers: Only females everyone!  They forage for the food, AKA pollen, and nectar.  They protect the hive and are the only ones you\u2019ll see flying outside.  Drones: Hello males!  They need to mate with any new queen.  Also, for some weird reason, drones are kicked out in winter.\n\nHabitat\nInsects are really adaptive animals.  They live on every single environment on earth.  They live in place from deserts to rainforests.  Now, if they can live anywhere, do some live in the arctic?  Actually yes.  Bees, wasps, plant lice, butterflies, moths, mosquitoes, and flies all live in the arctic circle.  But are bugs really important to the food chain?  Well, animals that mainly feed on insects my die of starvation because they don\u2019t have food to eat.  Also, plants that rely on pollinators like bees, will die away.  So, since bugs are important, next time you see a bug in your house, let it out.  If you see a bug outside, leave it alone.\n\nMetamorphosis\nStage one and three of the metamorphosis are not really exciting.  Most insects go through a metamorphosis.  If they do, they all start with an egg  Not much to say.  The second stage is the larvae.  They eat and eat and eat and eat\u2026  The next state is the pupa.  It also sits and does nothing like the egg.  The last stage is the adult.  It is the ladybug, butterfly, or whatever you see.\n\nConclusion\nNow you now a lot about insects.

Cats are the best pet you can have. Cats are the best pet because they are playful, they cuddle you, and most of all they are nice to new people. One reason that cats are the best pet is that they are playful. For example they can play all day with a ball of yarn when they are a kitty. Another example is with feathers that have a bell inside the feathers. One last example if cats really want that feather they will jump almost 2 feet in the air.\n\nReason 2\n\nAnother reason that cats are the best pet to have is they cuddle with you. For example they can sleep all night with you. Another example is that they can sit on your lap and you can pet them nicely. One last example is that if you are quiet they will sleep in your lap.\n\nReason 3\n\nAlthough cats are the best pet because they are playful, they cuddle with you, especially cats are the best pet to have is because they are nice to new people. For example John Bradshaw states that cats don\u2019t understand us as well as dogs. Another example is that they can scratch them self on your leg and that\u2019s how you know they like you a little bit. One last example is you can scratch their neck their head will tilt upward letting you know to scratch around that spot more.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion cats are the best pet to have because they are playful, they cuddle with you, and most of all because they are nice to new people.

Space Flight\n\nThere are many benefits of space flight but unfortunately 21 people have died in the effort to go to space.  These people were on Apollo 1, Soyuz 1, Soyuz 11, Challenger, and Collumbia.  All which have sadly failed to safely return tis crew to Earth.\n\nOne of these failed missions was Apollo 1.  Apollo 1 killed a crew of three including, Gus Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee on January, 27, 1967.  Something that makes Apollo 1 different from other tragedies was that Apollo 1 failed during a practice launch.  Things started to go wrong when the astronauts smelled something strange in their space suit.  A high oxygen flow through the cabin also caught their attention.  They thought they had fixed it.  Other things started going wrong, including faulty communication which they fixed for the most part.  But then suddenly an electric fault sparked and a fire swept through the cabin killing the entire crew of three.\n\nLater, approximately 3 months after Apollo 1, tragedy struck again.  The tragedy was Soyuz 1.  Soyuz 1 killed Russian, Vladimir Komarov, on April, 24, 1967.  Unlike Apollo 1, Soyuz 1 launched successfully on April, 23, 1967.  Unfortunately, things started going wrong right off the bat.  During launch, the left satellite did not come out, cutting the power supply in half.  Because of that one problem, things automatically started to go wrong.  On April, 24, 1967, it was time to return to Earth.  The return to Earth began well until the main parachute failed to come out.  Without the main parachute the spacecraft came crashing down and hit the ground hard.  The impact caused the solid fuel booster to blow up, killing Vladimir Komarov.\n\nAbout 4 years later, tragedy struck a third time.  This tragedy was Soyuz 11.  Soyuz 11 carried aboard Georgi Dobrovolski, Victor Patsayer, and Vladislav Volkov.  Like Soyuz 1, Soyuz 11 launched successfully June, 6, 1971.  The point of the mission was to dock with Salyut 1 for three weeks.  Everything went well until reentry.  During reentry a valve opened causing a pressure leak through the cabin.  Today during reentry people are more protected, but not in 1971.  The capsule continued to fall towards earth staying on the right route.  Back on earth the person communicating with the astronauts thought there was a communication problem, but only when the rescue opened the capsule did they find out the three of them did not make it.\n\nFor almost 15 years everything went well in the space program struck again.  This time the disaster was the Challenger.  The Challenger carried Mike Smith, Dick Scobee, Ron McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Christa McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, and Judith Resnik, on January, 28, 1986.  Right from the start things looked wrong.  On the day of the launch, it was 32 degrees fahrenheit, and footlong icicles hung from the launch pad.  The cold temperatures caused the solid rocket boosters to allow air to enter.  As the space shuttle rocked through the air, flames started making their way out of the boosters.  The flames burned through the fuel tank and supports that held the boosters to the fuel tank, causing the boosters to fall.  On the way down the boosters hit the fuel tank causing it to blow up 73 seconds after lift off.\n\nNASA learned from these mistakes, but about 17 years another setback took place on February 1, 2003.  On February 1, David Brown, William McCool, Michael Anderson, Kalpana Chawla, Rick Husband, Laurel Clark, and Lian Ramon lost their lives in the Columbia.  During launch, a piece of foam insulation the size of a couch from the fuel tank hit a seal on the left wing.  Surprisingly, the Columbia was able to make it into space.  During reentry through the small gap the seal left allowed hot gas inside the cabin.  This caused Columbia to blow apart.\n\nAlthough Apollo 1, Soyuz 1, Soyuz 11, Challenger and Columbia have failed to return their crew safely to earth, there are still many benefits of space flight.  To this very day people still go to space.  They just have to hope for the best.", "doctitle": "03_Nett_5", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 34.5, "average": 2.88, "criteria": {"overall": 3.5, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 3.5, "craft": 3.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 3.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "Used different kinds of information to teach subjects", "lead": "Shared what topics were to follow.

The cause of this is Global Warming. Global Warming is the warming of our atmosphere. How Global Warming effects these animals is by destroying their shelter, kills their food sources, and causing more destructive natural disasters. There are many ways that we can help.\n\nIn the forest, global warming destroys animal shelters and destroying trees by causing them to die from thirst. Global warming also increases the chances of Forest fires which will affect many animal habitats. Just so you know, by cutting down trees for houses or for other uses, we release co2 that the tree absorbed. In the Arctic, global warming melts its ice, strands animals, and rigged some food chains in the Arctic already. For example, polar bears feast on seals, but global warming kills the polar bears, then the seals get overpopulated and eat more and more fish, that also means that there is less food in the ocean for predators that prey on fish, this also goes for other animals in the Arctic. In the Ocean, co2 poisons the water and kills fish, global warming is also causing the destruction of coral reefs, the ocean has already lost \u2153 of its coral reefs which will endanger the species that depend on the coral to survive.\n\nAll animals can\u2019t survive without food but global warming destroys the animals\u2019 food sources. Like I already mentioned, global warming destroys coral that fish depend on for food and shelter, this will effect sharks, dolphins, tigers, wolves, etc. this will shorten all of those animals listed above food sources. The forest is where most Herbivores are and Carnivores that prey on them, how global warming effects both of them is it destroys food producing plants that animals depend on(us too!) which will starve the herbivores which will kill the food that the carnivores eat.\n\nGlobal warming doesn\u2019t just make natural disasters appear more often, but it makes them more destructive. For example, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tsunamis that form on water kill many animals in the ocean. Other natural disasters like forest fires and tornados that form on ground kill lions, elephants, and other animals that you might love. In the artic, is were heat waves(heat tempetures that the animals in the artic are not use to) frys animals and melts the ice. \nWhere are some ways to help slow down global warming and help the animals Walk, bike, skateboard, or take a bus instead of using a car, plant trees and other plants(plants and trees absorb co2), carpool(burn less gas), use LED light bulbs(save more energy than regular light bulbs), use rechargeable batteries(less E-waste), bring cloth bags instead of paper or plastic(plastic fills up landfills and paper is made by cutting down trees which releases the carbon dioxide that is in that tree), don\u2019t forget the 3 green R\u2019s(reduce, reuse, recycle)\n\nAnd most importantly\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 Spread the word to SAVE THE ANIMALS\n\nAs you can see, global warming effects animals, their food, and habitats, and the danger levels of natural disaters for them. You know that if we continue this rate of climate change, animals might face extinction and we might be one of them.\n\rGlossory\n\nExtinction: the state or process of a species, family, or larger group being or becoming extinct.\nAtmosphere: the envelope of gases surrounding the earth or another planet.\nCO2: Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas found in our atmosphere. Its chemical formula is CO2, which means it is one carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. Itis a waste product in our bodies and is also produced by burning fossil fuels.\nHerbivores: an animal that feeds on plants.\nCarnivores: an animal that feeds on meat.", "doctitle": "01_Stuck_5",

So what I am going to teach and tell you about in this book is different types of Teams, Tumbling, and the Competitions. Do you love Cheerleading well if you do that is great but if you don\u2019t then you should consider reading this book. Cheerleading is no ordinary sport it is were you learn how to do stunts, tumbling, what team you are going to be on and it is where to get to met new friends to. Cheerleading is good when you want to get better at your tumbling and to learn new skills and where you get to met new friends and sometimes when you are watching football then you see Cheerleaders and you can be on one of those teams to. So now let\u2019s get into the book and learn what cheerleading is all about.\n\nTeams\nDid you know that there are different kinds of teams in cheerleading if not I am going to teach, and tell you all about this. Teams that are judged by a panel of Cheerleading experts on difficulty and execution. Cheer squads typically have between 5 to 35 athletes. Cheerleading is fun when you get put on a team and then sometimes you get on a team that you don\u2019t like so then you can get angry but if you do it more then you will love that you got on that team. Well Know that you now about the teams they have you can go on to the tumbling on the other page.\n\nTumbling\n\tSo do you know how to to do tumbling? Well some people may know how to but some maybe don\u2019t know so I am going to tell ou and of course teach you to. So if you want to know how to do a back handspring then I will teach you so how you do it is you have to be flexible and you have to know how to do a backward walkover and then you go to someone like a couch and they can teach you and after years or months then you would be able to do them anywhere. Then if you want to do a round off then you need to be able to do a cartwheel then you just snap your legs together and then you have a round off. So know you know how to do a round off and a cartwheel then you can hope on over to the Comitisions and I will teach you all about them in the Comitision so go on over so you can find out more. One more thing you can do good on the Competitions if you just believe in yourself and you need to do more stuff to do the competition.\n\nCompetition\n\tDo you know what a Cheer Competition is? If not I am going to teach, and tell you. A Competition is when a Cheer squad compete against each other at a Competition and also when you do Cheer then when you go on stage to perform then you get a little nervous but is its fun when you are done and you won\u2019t regret it. When you go to a Cheer Competitions then your routine is usually a 2 minute routine and you usually do your routine with music that includes stunts, jumps, and tumbling. So now you know what Comitisions are.\n\nConclusion\n\tSo know that you now about the Teams, Tumbling, and the Competition that you would want to start Cheerleading and If you are looking for a adventure then you should do Cheerleading.

National Geographic. Gray wolves are very interesting animals. They have a unique diet, packs, and a shrinking population.\n\nWolf Diet\n\tWolves in packs eat large prey like deer, elk, and moose. Wolves are scavengers which means they eat animals that have already died. They can consume 20 pounds of meat at a sitting. Wolves also eat smaller prey like fish, birds, and lizards. Adults hunt food to feed pups and family.\n\nWolf Pack\n\tWolves hunt in packs with around six to ten animals. Packs roam huge distances, about 12 miles every day. They signal each other with their howls. A wolf howls to attract his pack\u2019s attention Sometimes a wolf is howling because another wolf is howling. They do this when the moon is full.\n\nWolf Population\n\tThere are about 300,000 wolves left in the world. Wolves don\u2019t attack humans, but they still are fearful predators to other animals. Just because of this, wolves are being threatened to death by humans. Wolves like the Red Wolf is endangered.\n\nConclusion\n\tIn conclusion, wolfs have a interesting diet, packs, and some endangered types.", "doctitle": "06_Chandra_03", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 25.5, "average": 2.12, "criteria": {"overall": 2.5, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 1.0, "ending": 2.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.0, "craft": 2.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 3.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 1055, "end_index": 1057, "old_text": "is", "new_text": "are", "type": "grammar", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 1098, "end_index": 1103, "old_text": "wolfs", "new_text": "wolves", "type": "spelling", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 1109, "end_index": 1110, "old_text": "a", "new_text": "an", "type": "grammar", "comment": ""}], "checkboxes": {"checked": ["2-0_lead", "3-0_lead", "4-0_lead", "4-1_lead", "2-0_transitions", "2-0_ending", "4-0_ending", "2-0_organization", "3-0_organization", "3-1_organization", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_organization", "4-1_organization", "4-2_organization", "2-0_elaboration", "3-0_elaboration", "4-0_elaboration", "4-1_elaboration", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_elaboration", "2-0_craft", "3-0_craft", "3-1_craft", "4-4_craft", "4-5_craft", "0-1_spelling", "0-0_punctuation", "0-1_grammar", "0-6_grammar"], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_punctuation", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_overall", "3-0_ending", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "4-0_craft", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_ending", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}]}, {"id": 80, "plaintext": "Gray Wolves\n\tDid you know that Gray wolves are the biggest living wild canine species.

Even though they can be friends, I vote cats! I think that cats are reliable pets. Cats are reliable pets because they are very smart, they are easy to handle, and most of all, because they teach you responsibility.\n\nOne reason that cats are reliable pets is that they are very smart.\nFor example, a cat's memory is 200 times as long as a dogs!\nAnother example for this is that if you have an outdoor cat, it will look on both sides when it crosses the street.\nLastly, since they can't talk to you in human languagem they use body language such as their tails!\n\nAnother reason that cats are reliabler pets is that they are easy to handle.\nFor example, you don't need to do as much exercise for them like taking them on walks, or going outside to play with them.\nSecond of all, it is easier to plan a trip because they don't drink as much water, and they don't need to go outside to do anything physical, or go to the bathroom.\nLastly, cats are less active and need less taking care of.\n\nAlthough cats are reliable pets because they are smart, or because they are easy to handle.\nCats are especially reliable pets because they teach you responsibility.\nOne example for this is that you have to feed them and look out for them.\nAnother example for this is that you have to play with them a few minutes a day.\nLastly, they teach you to be a good friend.\n\nIn conclusion, cats are reliable pets because they are very smart, they are easy to handle, and most of all, because they teach you responsibility.\nI think that besides all of this, cats are the greatest pets!\nWould you get a cat after reading this?\n", "doctitle": "02_Alarid_4", "grades": [{"version": 1,

{"id": 86, "plaintext": "Australian Shepherds\n\n\nIntroduction\n\tDo you need a dog that can work for you but also play with the extra work energy it has? If so, this is the perfect dog for you. Yes, I said you! If you do think of getting this dog ever in your lifetime, this book can tell you many things of how to take great care of a Australian Shepherd. In order to know the basics about this dog, you will need to know a good meal for it, its outer beauty, and maybe even a question that many people ask like, why is it named that.\n\n\tWho knows, maybe this book will inspire you to become a Shepherd expert.\n\nWhat can this dog do?\nPlay with you\nWork outside\nAlways be alert\nHelping around the house\nEtc. (Much more!)\n\nThis Aussie is outside, panting from working hard or running around on possibly a walk or just running around for fun.\n\nA Good Meal\n\t\u201cChomp, chomp!\u201d That\u2019s the sound of an Australian Shepherd eating a good  meal after all of its hard work in the fields. There are many food to choose for these majestic dogs. One good and healthy food for these Shepherds are wet food. Australian Shepherds tend to love this type of food because of the wetness, but if you are the person who wants to clean up their dog bowl because it smells bad or you just want to clean it in general, it won\u2019t be super hard but it will turn into a mess in your sink or trash can. If you get dry dog food, these dogs will eat this food for sure if their hungry. It\u2019s best to get grain-free fry dog food for them and its not alot healthier. The dry dog food puppys like a lot too plus its not as big as a mess. These food are both very good and healthy for the dogs, but dog treats are also great for them! There are many different kinds of dog treats, some even very unhealthy for certain breeds. Next time you go to the store to get dog food for your Australian Shepherd, I recommend to look what\u2019s in the food. If there are no ingredients on the container/bag, you probably shouldn\u2019t get it. Or if there are a bunch of ingredients that sound unhealthy to dogs, don\u2019t get it. \n\nMake sure your Shepherd can munch on something food for them next time you buy them there food.\n\n\nOuter Beauty \nGorgeous Aussies on the inside, but also on the outside. How do they look though? Well, many Aussies (Aussie means Australian Shepherd) look very similar, but there are things that look different about them like their height, eyes, and possibly even coat colors. Male Australian Shepherds are commonly 20 to 23 inches tall to the shoulder, while female Aussies are often 18 to 22 inches tall to the shoulder. These dogs aren't the biggest, but also not the smallest. Many people just say that their medium sized dogs, not exact height. \nAussies also have perdant ears (ears that go up) and a bobtail. A lot of dogs get their normal tails cut off the get bobtails, but not this dog! Their bobtails and perdant ears match very perfectly with their coat colors. The well known coat colors of the Aussies are black, gray, white, and tan. But, those colors are only for the Blue Aussie, there are different coat colors and also for their eyes. These different types of Australian Shepherds still do look very similar so people will know, but they just have color differences. Black Aussies normally have brown eyes and Red Aussies have either amber eyes or blue and amber eyes. But of course, there are many more types of Aussies with many different eye colors a coat colors. Are you the one who will research about the types of Aussies and what their beauty is? \n\n\nWhy is it Named That? \nA very common question, that many ask, that many wonder and think of everyday. Why is it named that? Well, there are many theories that people think, and nobody actually knows the real answer to that question, but a theory that hundreds and maybe thousands of people have is this. \nAustralian Shepherds are named Australian because they have a blue merle pattern (blue eyes) similar many dogs brought over from Australia to America; thus, because of the color pattern, they were simply called \"Australian\" as so many other dogs were that had the blue merle. \nThis explains and hopefully answers the mysterious question of, \"Why is it named that?\". \n\nConclusion\nMeals, outer beauty, and even the reason to its name. What more could you ask for? You now might be an intermediate at this breed of dogs and could maybe become advanced if you practice enough! Could you be the one, who will answer the unknown of these dogs? If you don't think so,  I want you to try. \n\nMaybe, like I said at the beginning, are you inspired because of these dogs?\n\n\n\n\n ", "doctitle": "05_Nguyen_1", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 32.0, "average": 2.67, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 2.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 3.0, "craft": 3.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 3.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "Lots of good info on aussies", "lead": "I am hooked.

Grey wolves are carnivores animals, they live in a lot of places, and they have a interesting way of behaving.\n\nCarnivores Animals\nFirst, Grey Wolves can have a large variety of food. For example they eat meat, like elk, deer, moose, and sometimes bison. Also if they are not successful with catching a bigger meal for the pack, they hunt for smaller animals like lizards, birds, and smaller mammals. Adult Grey wolves can eat up to 20 pounds in one meal. Sometimes they can eat fruit. 1 thing I forgot is that they eat snakes.\n\n They live in a lot of Places\n\tAdditanaly, Grey Wolves can live in a lot of places. For example they can live in Asia, Alaska, and Canada. They live in cold or warm weather. Also they can live in a forest or on a mountain. Grey wolves can even live in the desert. Also they can live in many more places. Their Habitat has trees, snow in the winter, and maybe warm in summer.\n\nGrey Wolves have a Interesting Way of behaving\n\tFinally, Grey Wolves have a interesting way of behaving. For example Grey wolves can communicate by howling like we all know, but also communicate by using their body. When a grey wolf is happy it wags its tail and has its tongue sticking out. Maybe if you have a dog, this is what it does when it is happy and when another Grey Wolf wants to fight with another Grey wolf, it will approach with a growl or lay it\u2019s ears back on it\u2019s head.\n\nConclusion\n\tIn conclusion, Grey wolves are carnivorous animals, they live in a lot of places, and they have a interesting way of behaving. Sometimes grey wolves die each day because of hunting, but maybe when you are older you can stop grey wolves from being hunted or poisoned, because soon they will be near extinction.\n", "doctitle":

Well I do. Oh you don't know what it is surprise surprise. Then today I will be teaching about baseball. I will teach you about what is it, bases, and player/teams. So I hope you love my writing and learn a lot.\n\nFwoosh, \"Strike three you're out\" the catcher says with a despairing tone in his voice. Today I'll teach you about rules. One of the first most known rule is three strikes you're out. Another well known rule is if you hit the home plate after touching every other base you score a point. Another is you have to get the ball to the hot spot to get someone out if there not on a base. Or you can catch the ball right when they hit it no matter where they are.\n\nHave you ever watched or played baseball? Well if you have then you may know the bases. The main base the one you hit at is called the home base. When you hit the first base you run to is pretty much what it is first base. The second one you run to is considered second base. The third one is third base. Then it's back to the dugout.\n\nTeams are one of the most important parts of baseball. TOday I will teach you about the most known teams. Some of the most known teams include Dodgers, Giants, yankees, and red sox. There other teams like the cardinals too. There are also teams like the angeles, blue jays, rangers, astros, athletics, and rays wich aren't as popular but still really popular.\n\nSo I hoped you learned a lot about baseball.

Nitro funny cars are super powerful because they have nitro in the tank, because they have 10,000 horsepower, and most of all because they have brave drivers.\n\nOne reason Nitro funny cars are super powerful is that they have the biggest engine out of any car. Even though they are scary looking, they are the best and fastest motorsport in the world. Also they have a 10,000 horsepower engine which is insane to think about. To add on they have changed overtime the engines have made way more horsepower, they have way different speeds and horsepower.\n\nAnother reason Nitro funny cars are super powerful is that they have 10 to 11,000 horsepower. Continuously, they are SO loud they can shake you anywhere you are they're so powerful. Also did you know that the fastest nitro funny car run was shattered by robert hight at 337.66 MPH! According to google search. My second evidence for that is they are the fastest thing on the planet that's how fast they even are. To add on those cars can pull a 4 to 5 g-force which is big on your body. My third evidence for that is drag racing is scary and exciting to watch. Drag racing is scary, awesome, and frightening at the same time.\n\nAlthough nitro funny cars are super powerful because they have massive motors and because they run on two of the fastest fuels especially nitro funny cars are super powerful because the tires they have are super grippy. To begin with, the 2 fuels they run on are either aucohaule, or nitromethane. My second evidence for that is i learn alot from my grandpa because he raced in his career, so i learn alot from him In conclusion nitro funny cars are super powerful because they have the fastest accelerating engine on earth, they have huge motors, and most of all, because they have 10,000 horsepower. I think that nitro funny cars are the best funny car out of the two because the other one the regular funny car has the two main fuels. The question leaving you guys thinking about is: would you go out to a drag race and have your body being shook by those engines?

Soccer has existed since December 19th, 1855. The objective of soccer is more than just scoring goals. You also need to know all the positions in soccer.\r\n\r\nThe History of Soccer\r\n\tSoccer has been around for over 200 years. It has evolved from kicking a leather ball into a full-on real soccer ball. When soccer was first made the rules were pretty much just no tripping and you cannot touch the ball with your hands. But then it kept evolving and the rules became more serious and more sophisticated. For example, the penalty kick was introduced in 1891!\r\n\r\nThe Objective of Soccer\r\n\tThe objective of soccer is definitely a lot more than just trying to score goals. For example, your trying to pass the ball up the field to your teammates who try to kick the ball into the goal. Then the other team brings it to the half field and has kickoff which gives them the ball, and then they try to score a goal against your goal. But then there\u2019s the goalie so he will try to block the goal with his hands. (the goalie is the only one who can use his hands.) Then after half time you will switch sides and try to score on the other goal. After the game is over the team with the most goals wins the game.\r\n\r\nThe Positions of Soccer\r\n\tThe positions in soccer very hard to learn only because there\u2019s a lot of them. Forwards (Centre forward, Second striker, and Winger.) Forwards and strikers are the ones that go up towards the other team\u2019s goals and try to score a goal. Midfield(Centre midfield, Defensive midfield, Attacking midfield, Wide midfield.) Midfielders are doing both defense and offense for there team. Defender (Centre-back, Sweeper, Full-back, Wing-back.) Defense will keep the other team out of there side so the other team can\u2019t score on them. Lastly, the goalkeeper who will make sure that none of the balls that the other team shoots at him go in the goal.\r\n\tSoccer has existed since December 19th, 1855.

On-Demand \nSan Luis Obispo History \n\nIntroduction \nDid you know that The Chumash native american tribe traded often with other tribes? Did you know that San Luis Obispo got its name from mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa? Did you know that San Luis Obispo used to be a part of Mexico? All of this is because of San Luis Obispo's history. Without these happenings of history, San Luis Obispo wouldn't be the way people know it today. Read on to learn about the Chumash tribe, the Mission period, and the Rancho period. \n\nThe Chumash  \nThe Chumash tribe was very resourceful. Whenever this tribe killed an animal, or picked natural plants, they tried to use up every resource from it. They built houses made of wooden frames from willow trees. They then covered these frames with long strands of tulle. The Chumash wore deerskin skirts and robes in the winter, and wore tulle skirts in the summer. Consequently, the climate never bothered them. The Chumash women would gather fruits and berries, while the Chumash men would hunt rabbits, deer, and fish. To hunt fish, They built redwood canoes called tomols. These tomols were usually 8-30 feet long. The tribe relied on this, for aquatic organisms were an important part if their diet. The Chumash diet usually consisted of fish, shellfish, deer, berries, seeds, birds, rabbits, and acorns. They would mash the acorns to make a flour, which they would then use to cook breads, soups, and mushes. \n\nThe mission Period \nIn the 1700's and the 1800's Spain wanted to settle Alta California to convert, or change, the beliefs of the native americans. They did this by building missions (Spanish settlements used as churches). When the 5th mission was founded in San Luis Obispo, it changed the lives of the Chumash greatly. The Spanish government bribed the tribe by promising food, shelter, and clothing to come and live at the mission. Some natives needed all of these items, and so they lived at the mission. Natives who tried to escape the mission got beaten. A native that had lived at a nearby mission explains what daily mission life is like. \"Every morning at sunrise, I wake up to the sound of church bells. All of the mission families hurry off to church, where Priests lead us in prayers. After church, we go home to breakfast. We eat tortillas, fruit, and milk. After breakfast, I go to school or work in fields. We rest after lunch and more prayers. At the end of the day, we eat supper and have more prayers, than finally rest. Sometimes the Spaniards are cruel to us, and at other times I'm just glad to be within mission walls.\" \n\nThe Rancho Period  \nWhen Mexico broke away from Spain and won independence, California became a part of Mexico. The mission period then ended, because most missions were secularized. This means that the mission lands were given away to Mexican citizens. The Mexican citizens then turned these lands into ranchos. A rancho is a huge plot of land owned by powerful people, usually used to raise animals and grow crops to sell for money. The men that owned ranchos were called rancheros, and the woman who owned ranchos were called rancheros. These people hired the native americans to work in the fields, but the native americans didn't get rewarded for their deeds. The rancho period ended when California finally won it's independence back. \n\nConclusion \nAII in all, San Luis Obispo has gone through a lot of history points to be the way it is today. Studying this topic made me think that history can be very important for it is always the reason behind why we live the way we live.

Magic the gathering is interesting because there are collectables, types of cards, and lastly the game rules.\n\nOne reason magic the gathering is interesting is there are collectables. (mtg wiki says) My first evidence is that you can get lots of new cards to build new and better and better decks. Also, when you opening a booster pack (get booster packs get 15 new cards) you have no idea what your gonna get! You could get a legendary card, more on that later. Lastly because when your making a new deck the cards from a booster pack could help you make lots of decks or one. These cards can help you win a game! you can also buy cards online-\n\nAnother reason magic is interesting is because is the types of cards. Famdom said that (my first evidence is) there is 13 different types of cards in magic. Also all the cards in the game are sorted by sliver, black, legendary, and mythic legendary. legendary color is gold mythic is bright orange lastly the cards have different abilities that at the right time it could make you win.\n\nAlthough magic the gathering is interesting because the collectables, also the types of cards, most of all the game rules. First because some cards you can only use one time during your turn, and some you can only use one time in the game! Also some cards that have abilities that can help you win, for example trample, if a creature has trample if a creature blocks it, it will take damage to the player your playing.\n\nIn conclusion Magic is interesting because collectibles types of cards and most of all the game rules. I think that everyone could have fun to play this game.

learned that they can be vicious. There are over 700 different types of dinosaurs. And each one of these dinosaurs lived in one of four different eras of the dinosaur time. There are many theories about how and why the dinosaurs became extinct. \nFirst, there were many different types of dinos. One of the most famous dinosaurs was the Tyrannosaurus Rex. This dinosaur was the king of all dinosaurs. Based on scientific evidence it would grow to be 15 or 20 feet tall and its mass would be 13,000 to 32,000 lb! This dinosaur is in a lot of movies for its size and its vicious attitude. Another famous dinosaur is the Velociraptor. Also based on more scientific evidence it as said that it was \"0.5 meters tall\", \"2 meters long\", and it weighed \"15 kilograms\". And both of these dinosaurs were carnivores. One othee dinosaur is the Sauroposeidon. The tallest dinosaur in the world! Based on more scientific evidence it was 20 to 23 feet high, it's length was 92 to 110 feet long, and it weighed 100,000 to 120,000 lb! \n\nSecond, there were three main eras that the dinosaurs lived in. One example is the Triassic period.The Triassic period was \"248 to 206 million years ago\". In the Triassic period a massive disaster happened. The disaster wiped out 90% of earth's species. A couple years later the population began to regrow of different species, and more sea creatures came into the water. And dinosaurs started to appear more on land. The second period is the Cretaceous Period. It was \"146 to 65 million years ago\" In this time the land masses were the same as right now, but the continents were splitting up a d the ocean was filing in the cracks. And the dinosaurs were evolving. And different types of new birds came along. Lastly the Jurassic period. It started \"208 to 146 million years ago.\" at this time the earth was rapidly breaking up and forging mountains. The Dinosaurs were evolving more and becoming taller and bigger. \n\nThird, there were many different ways how the dinosaurs  went extinct. One example is the volcano. When volcanoes erupted the lava would oze out of the volcano and burn all living life Including the dinosaurs, plants, and trees. And all the smoke would glog up the sky then the dinosaurs could not get fresh air and breath. Another reason why the dinosaurs went extinct was asteroids. When an asteroids hit the earth it could've hit some of the dinosaurs in the area. Then it would send dirt, plants, and dust flying then it would clog up the air then they would have no fresh air. And since it came down on the atmosphere really fast it would be covered in flames then it would hit the earth and put it in flames. \n\n\nLastly, There is still a lot about dinosaurs we don't know about. There could be a new different dinosaur. Or something could've happened in one of the eras we don't already know about. Or maybe there was a different thing that made the dinosaurs go extinct. Based on some scientific evidence scientists found out that the T Rex dinosaur evolved into a chicken? So that basically means that dinosaurs are still living with us. \n\n\n", "doctitle": "05_Nguyen_5", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 34.5, "average": 2.88, "criteria": {"overall": 3.5, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 3.5, "craft": 3.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 3.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "Very professional tone", "lead": "Great information in P1.

The ocean has different animal and different stuff. The ocean is a humongous place,and did you know that the world is half covered of water. So the world is like a island but it isn't a island. Scientist don't consider it a island it's more like a subcontinent. \n\nDifferent animals\nIn the sea there different animals for example fish,clown fish, great white shark hammerhead shark, starfish, killer whale, sea horse, crabs, ,blue whale, sea lions and squid but many more. There thousand and thousand of sea creatures in the ocean can be so dangerous that maybe they could be a sign that says beware of sharks or jellyfish.The ocean is way deeper than you thought they can even be more different animals that we have not discovered. A long time ago there was a dinosaur whale that lived underwater 65 million years ago but it got extinct\n\nSharks \nWhen your at the ocean or beach they might be a sign that says beware of sharks. Sharks are bloodthirsty animal if you bleed of have a cut and if like scuba diving Beware because sharks can smell from miles away. Sharks don't have bones because there mostly jiggling in the water. Most sharks have the best eyesight and There skin feels like sandpaper. Did you know that sharks were here for 425 million years ago. \n\nJellyfish \nJellyfish are dangerous animals they sting and if you have a kid thats get stung it could instant kill them but if your a adult it can cause deaf or really bad injure. People think that just a jellyfish sting is not that bad but it can kill you. A group Of jellyfi is called a bloom , smack or swarm. The box jellyfish is really painful it can kill you. Jellyfish it plankton and different kind of plankton they eat plants. Did you know that some jellyfish even eat other jellyfish!\n\nCONCLUSION \nNow you know about the ocean you should go visit it , or you can go scuba,diving, jet skiing or Water jets it's when you are connected to a rope that has water jets that you trying to balance. Thank you for reading my essay now you should know about the ocean more. There's cool stuff that you can learn from the ocean. You should go fishing to eat fish,shark,squid or whatever you like there all good. \n\n", "doctitle": "05_Nguyen_7", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0,

The bull shark lives in, saltwater and freshwater areas unlike most sharks, the bull also lives on the gulf of mexico, in the mississippi oceans and in shallow waters. The size of the bull shark is between 2-4 meters long. The color is a sandy beige. and if you get bitten then you should go to a hospital right away because the infection of a shark bit is so dangerous wherever you got bit by may get amputated or worse!

But I am here to only teach you about one. And its Roblox. lastly, you will learn about the games in Roblox. Come with me and learn all about Roblox!\n\n\tI will now teach you about the money in Roblox. The money in Roblox is called Robux. You can use it to buy outfits, gear, avatars, animation's, and new faces and hair styles. You can also buy money in a game with Robux. you can upgrade your house with Robux. You can also donate robux to a friend. The bad thing about Robux is that you have to pay money in real life to get Robux. You have to pay $5 for 400 Robux, and $10 for 800 Robux. Robux is a really clever name.\n\n\tNow I will teach you about the friends in Roblox. To get a friend in Roblox is really easy. All you have to do is at the bottom of the screen you click on friends and you can search up any person in the game. It can be your best friend or someone famous that plays the game and then you click the send friend request and you wait maybe a few days and they might of accepted it. You can join your friends while there playing a game. You can make new friends in the game or they can be your best friend.\n\n\tNow, lastly I will teach you about the games in Roblox. What I mostly like about Roblox is the games there is SO MANY games. in Roblox there is billions of games in the game. They are all made by other players. That's also what I like is that there made by you. Its so fun because you can spend Robux in a game and you can play with a friend. Here is some examples for games: Jailbreak, Bloxburg, Doomspire Brickbattle, Work At A Pizza Place, and run hide escape. There are a lot of games! :)\n\n\tI taught you about Roblox. I taught you about the Robux. Next, I taught you about friends. Lastly, I taught you about the games in Roblox.

Sharks actually have better eyesight than you can actually think.\r\n\r\n\tTo keep your local sharks alive, make posters, make flags, or tell people to stop hurting sharks with your voice. If your going to make a poster then first get a piece of white paper then write in big letters STOP KILLING SHARKS then draw a shark with a circle around it with a line going through it. And it will look something like this Or if your going to make a flag then take two white shirts and cut one of the arm sleeves off and cut it in half then sew it on to the head whole and turn the shirt around and then draw and write whatever you want to. And how to tell someone with your voice write a speech.\r\n\r\n\tErgo, 100 million sharks die a year. The most endangered sharks are bull sharks , great white sharks and atlantic green sharks. You\u2019re probably thinking, how can we keep our local sharks alive.While that\u2019s why i\u2019m here; here to keep your local sharks alive. Sharks should not be dying as fast as they are.

I hope so! I love my mom because she does stuff for me like help me with things I can't do I my own, taking care of me, and encouraging me to do things that I don't feel certain about. Why should you continue reading? You should keep reading because you might relate to something I wrote and you know that you're not the only one with those thoughts.\n\nHelpful\n\tDoes your mom help you when you're stuck on a math problem? My mom does, well, sometimes. My mom helps me with things that I can't do by myself. An example for this is when she helps me on homework. She does this by teaching me what it's asking me and shows me things that I didn't know how to do before. That's not the only reason my mom is helpful, she also makes sure I'm okay like when I'm going on a care trip. When I'm going on a long car ride she usually gives me pills to help me not get sick. One example for this is when she opens a water bottle for me when I can't. I know that might not seem like a lot, but I probably wouldn;t be able to open the water bottle without her help. And lastly, another example is when we're out somewhere and something is happening. I'm usually too short to see, so my mom carries me up so I can.\n\nCaring\n\tWhat does your mom do that's caring to you? My mom is caring to me by helping me take care of my tortoise, helping me with gardening, and giving me as much of her love as she can to me and my brother. Sometimes I can't do certain things to take care of my tortoise so my mom helps me with them. My mom feeds him everyday in the morning right after she drops me up from school. And she also takes him out in the garden when I can't, everyday. My mom also helps me with gardening. She does this by helping me not get too messy when by the soil. That may not seem that caring but it's actually a hard job. I'm a clumsy person and get messy easily so her help is very appreciated. And last of all, my mom is caring becase she\n\nEncouraging\n\tWhat things does your mom encourage you about?\n\n\nConclusion\n\tNow you hopefully know about how much my mom takes care of me, how encouraging she ism how helpful she is to me, and how amazing she is. But before you leave, I want to explain how I felt writing this. Do you usually get to spent time with your mom? Well I'm one of the many that do. Writing this made me realize that there was a lot of kids that don't though. And that made me think about how lucky I was and am to get to spend the amount of time that I do with my mom, and made me appreciate the things she does for me a little more. So if you do get to spend time with your mom, go tell her how grateful you are for what she does. But if you don't get to spend that much time with your mom, you should still thank her for getting to spend time with her at all, she'll really appreciate it. \n", "doctitle": "02_Alarid_7", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "Could be considered opinion rather than informational.\r\nAlso, did not complete subtopic #2 and #3", "score": {"total": 28.5, "average": 2.38, "criteria": {"overall": 2.5, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 4.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.5, "craft": 1.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 3.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "Written more like opinion", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": ["2-0_overall", "3-0_overall", "3-1_overall", "4-0_overall", "2-0_lead", "3-0_lead", "4-0_lead", "4-1_lead", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_transitions", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_transitions", "2-0_ending", "3-0_ending", "4-0_ending", "4-1_ending", "5-0_ending", "2-0_organization", "3-0_organization", "3-1_organization", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_organization", "4-1_organization", "4-2_organization", "2-0_elaboration", "3-0_elaboration", "4-0_elaboration", "4-1_elaboration", "4-3_craft"], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "3-0_craft", "3-1_craft", "3-2_craft", "4-0_craft", "4-1_craft", "4-1_overall", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}]}, {"id": 112, "plaintext": "Swimming\n\tDid you know that swimming is a water sport? It is a sport that you can get stronger after every stroke you do. You can also race opponents in swim meets or do practice racing. Today, you will learn about what equipment you need(gear) You will also learn where do you practice. Lastly, you will learn about knowing two famous swimmers.\n\tFirst of all, you will learn about what equipment youj will need. You don't need that much gear but you still need some equipment. You need a swimsuit and goggles. The other equipment is optional(kickboard, swim cap, fins, snorkel, hand paddles and a pool(the one that fits between your legs). You also need to find a pool to use all of your equipment.\n\tThen, you will now learn where to swim. If your wondering where to swim, pools can be both indoors and outdoors. Here are some examples where the pools are; Sinsheimer, Arroyo Grande High School, Kennedy Fitness, 5 Cities Drive, Atascadero, and many other places. Some places can teach you to swim, while others can have ou swim, whatever you need to.\n\tLastly, you will learn about two really famous swimmers. One is Michael Phelps. He is the most famous swimmer because in the Olympics before the last couple of years in the Olympics before he retired, Michael Phelps won EIGHT first places which was gold medals. One time, his goggle leaked and still broke the World Record. That was crazy!!!!!!! Michael Phelps was representing our country, which is United States of America. The other famous swimmer is Sun Yand. He represents for China. He is only good on freestyle which is a stroke, and he mostly wins races in the Olympics for long distances such as 400 meter freestyle, 800 meter freestyle, and the mile swim(1500 meters) in freestyle.

What do you know about these forest creatures? I will be telling you about where gray wolves live, what they eat, and how they were endangered. Prepare to test your knowledge with this report!\n\nWhere They Live\n\nIn a dark forest in Alaska a rustling noise can be heard. What is this mysterious sound? Suddenly, a gray wolf leaves into view!\n\nGray wolves can be found all over the Northern Hemisphere. Most of these animals are located around Canada, Alaska, Asia, Greenland, and sometimes Europe. Furthermore, these predators have warm coats for the cold places in which they live. Gray wolves need this habitat because of their diet. Most of the prey they hunt live in cold environments.\n\nWords To Know\n\nPredators: an animal that preys on others.\nEnvironment: the conditions in which a plant or animal operates\nDiet: what an animal/person usually eats\n\nWhat They Eat\n\nA deer grazes on some fresh grass. But with one quick leap, a wolf pounces on it! It licks its lips, as it tears apart its catch.\n\nMany gray wolves love to snack on deer, moose, and elk. They also can consume lizards, snakes, birds, and fruit. In fact, they are willing to eat 20 pounds of meat in one meal! These carnivores will roam 12 miles to find food! They also swim in lakes to catch fish and other various creatures. \n\nWords To Know\n\nConsume: eat, drink, or ingest (food or drink)\nCarnivore: an animal that feeds on meat or/and flesh\n\nHow They Were Endangered\n\nThe sound of a gunshot cracks the morning air. A gray wolf falls to its side. Men run towards the wolf\u2026\n\nWolves barely ever attack humans, however, they are still considered one of nature\u2019s fiercest predators. Millions of wolves were being abused in the form of shooting, poisoning, and trapped because of this reason. In 48 of the lower states, solves were threatened to extinction. Luckily, multiple wolf packs survived, and other spreaded.\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this research report. Wolves are very impressive creatures, and they accomplish a lot to survive. As you can see, it is important to wolves to live where they live, to eat what they do, and no longer able to become extinct. And who knows?

The crowd goes wild clapping and yelling! This is the sound of a goad soccer game. You are going to learn about skills that you need to win, what you wear, and the field that you play on. \n\nSkills\nTo play soccer you need skills to win. Some of the skills you need are dribbling and shooting. These two skills are important if you want to win. To score a goal you need to shoot it and you need to dribble to get to the goal. But sometimes you do fouls on the way. Some fouls that you don't want to do are elbowing people, kicking people really hard, knocking people over, giving people concussions and more. you don't want to do these things. \n\nWhat to wear \nTo be safe you need gear to play soccer. In soccer you need shin guards and cleats. shin guards help so you wont get kicked in the shin and cleats have little bumps on the bottom of the shoe that help you so you don't slid and so you run faster. You also are supplied with a jersey and shorts for the team that your coach usually gives you. \n\nThe field \nFinally you need to know about the field you play on. On a average soccer field there are 11 people playing at ones 4 forwards, 2 midfielders, 4 defenders and 1 goale on each team. There is also 1 ball on the field. The field itself is 110-120 yards. On the field there are 2 penalty boxes, sidelines, 2 goals, a center circle and 2 goal areas. \n\nConclusion \nAll in all you have learned about the skills you need, what to wear, and the field you play on. So now that you have learned all about soccer, i must go back to the game where they are waiting for me. Maybe someday you will actually play soccer! \n\n", "doctitle": "05_Nguyen_10", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 27.5, "average": 2.29, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 2.5, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.5, "craft": 2.0, "spelling": 2.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "Good visualization to hook your reader", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "Good separation of sections.

The gray wolves have all sorts of different ways of how they behave. From howling at the moon to watching their young. They have all sorts of different types of food that they eat like moose and lizards. They lives all over the world from europe to, alaska to, canada, and sometimes in deserts!\n\nThe Gray Wolf behavior\n\nFirst, the gray wolf behaves in many different ways. The gray wolves communicate more than just howling they snarl, yelp, bark, whimper, whine, and growl. They can also communicate through body language. If a wolf is feeling confident it\u2019s ears will be pointing straight up with it\u2019s head and tail held high and approach a wolf. If a wolf is not feeling confident \u201cit\u2019s body will be sinking low, with its ears down with it\u2019s head down and their tail through the wolf\u2019s legs.\u201d When a gray wolf howls their howl can be heard from 10 miles away! They howl more and more when the moon is full. The gray wolf usually howls when it\u2019s warning its pack of danger or when it\u2019s calling another pack.\n\nWhat The Gray Wolves Eat\n\nSecond, the gray wolf eats a lot of different things for example, elk, deer, beavers, rabbits, and fruit. Some of the wolves would go hunting while some of the other gray wolves would watch their young and protect them. When the gray wolves found prey they would surround the animal and bite it until it stopped moving. Then the gray wolves would come back with it and feed it to their baby\u2019s and to other gray wolves. Sometimes they would find a dead animal that already had been killed by another animal and still eat it. But other times they would just look for fruit and kill some lizards.\n\nWere The Gray Wolves Live\n\nThird, the gray wolves live in many different places. They live in alaska, Yellowstone, europe, canada, deserts, and the northern rockies. In the northern rockies the gray wolves used to have not a lot of gray wolves left in the northern rockies. Until Central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park started protecting the gray wolves. It took a long time to make people stop killing gray wolves. In alaska they have a lot of gray wolves. In fact it has the biggest population out of the entire united states! Just like Yellowstone National park had shooting problems alaska did to. But they would shoot the gray wolves for fun and for bounty. But this eventually stopped and the gray wolves appeared more.\n\nLastly, Gray wolves are always behaving in different ways. And always hunting for food. And they live all over the world! If gray wolves went extinct the population of their prey would go higher and higher! If you are going to alaska, canada, europe, or Yellowstone National park.

One last example to prove this reason is that learning self-defense will make you stronger so you can strike harder.\n\nAlthough MMA is a virtuoso sport because it is fun and because it teaches you self-defense especially MMA is a virtuoso sport because it teaches you respect.\n\n\tTo conclude, MMA is a virtuoso sport because it is fun, it teaches you self-defense, and most of all, MMA is a virtuoso sport because it teaches you respect. I think MMA is a virtuoso sport and it may seem rough but I think you should give it a try. Think about all the different types of sports in MMA and how it is all combined into one which is really cool.", "doctitle": "05_Campanile_7", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score":

Also, teaches you how to be responsible, and most of all, because you can learn to train them and the amount of food to give them. One reason that dogs help you with responsibility is that it shows you to take good care of them. For example, in the text Can dogs teach kids responsibility? Pet MD it says that you learn how to take good care of and animal also by always playing fetch that also helps you.

Lastly, how it helps kids learn to have fun while taking good care of them is that you can always teaching them new things in the way.\n\nAnother reason that you can take care of them is that you can give them fresh water. An example for this is, that you can give them fresh water to keep your dog healthy and hydrated because no one wants an  unhealthy dog. My second reason is, that it is ok to give them water, but you have to be careful with the water you give them because it might not be fine for you dog to drink it might have some  stuff your dog can't drink so you have to be careful, they can still drink the water you give them if it's ok for them to drink, so just an idea you can give them some fresh water. My last example, is that you can play with them every day, as I said in my first reason I said that it also helps you playing with them, what I mean by that is that it helps you in also going outside and exercising with your pet by that you should go play with your dog instead of staying inside all the time you should akshay try to try new things with your dog.\n\nAlthough you can learn new things with your dog and because you can have good times with them especially because it helps you learn to take good responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, dogs can teach you responsibility because you can show that in the future you can maybe get a job that includes responsibility, and get", "doctitle": "05_Campanile_8", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 24.5, "average": 2.04, "criteria": {"overall": 2.0, "lead": 2.0, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 1.5, "organization": 2.0, "elaboration": 2.5, "craft": 2.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "Info, but very opinion oriented.", "lead": "Needs more of a book", "transitions": "", "ending": "not complete", "organization": "starting to paragraph, but need work", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "Runons, periods", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 114, "end_index": 117, "old_text": "May", "new_text": null, "type": "word choice", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 147, "end_index": 148, "old_text": ",", "new_text": null, "type": "punctuation", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 366, "end_index": 372, "old_text": ".

Guinea pigs are the best pet. Guinea pigs are the best pet because you get to play with them, they eat your vegetables, and most of all, because they are a big responsibility.\n\n\tOne reason that guinea pigs are the best pet is that you get to play with them. First of all, you will have to be fast to get them as I said before they can go 5.5 mph. That is fast when you are inside and trying to catch your guinea pig. Additionally, they always love to play with you and they are so active and they love to play on obstacle courses. For example, if you make a little hertel they would try and might jump over it like a horse. And they also love going in and through tunnels back and forth. In addition, you can even play with a guinea pigs even when you are sick this is because they can not catch human viruses. That is a good thing because when you are sick and do not no what to do when you are sick and you have a guinea pigs play with them.\n\n\tAnother reason that guinea pigs are the best pet is that they eat all of your vegetables. First of all, guinea pigs can eat about 27 different types of fruit and vegetables. That is a lot of different types of food that one little rodent can eat. Additionally, most of the time for you kids out there any vegetable that you do not eat it is most likely a guinea can eat it for you. Sometimes guinea pigs are healthier than you are. In addition, did you know that guinea pigs always have food stored right in their mouth? You can tell by when they have been in your lap for a long time without food you can hear them chewing on something and that something is food.\n\n\tAlthough guinea pigs are the best pet because you get to play with them and because they eat your vegetables especially guinea pigs are the best pet because they are a big responsibility. First of all, you have to keep their cage clean so you have to clean it at least 3 time a month. And you also want to keep them clean so every time you clean their cage you should give them a bath. Additionally, they only have a lifespan of 4-8 years so enjoy all of your time together. The oldest guinea pig ever was 14 years old! That is almost double the years they are expected to live. In addition, you will need enough food and water for them to live. Guinea pigs eat 6 hours a day so you need enough food for them and enough water.\n\n\tIn conclusion, guinea pigs are the best pet because you get to play with them, they eat all your vegetables, and most of all, they are a big responsibility. I think guinea pigs are the best pet to ever have.

And About how to stay safe when you are doing gymastics.and about how to stretch so you don\u2019t get hurt\n\nWhy gymnastics is healthy?\n\n\tIt is healthy because you\u2019re getting exercise and you\u2019re also having fun.

A lot of people like gymnastics so i think people would be sad. And I think they would not like to not want gymnastics in the world because what if it\u2019s your favorite thing to do.and the only way to make them feel happy.And he was the first German to open a gymnastics center.\n\nHow to stay safe when you\u2019re doing gymnastics\n\nOne way you can stay safe is stretching. This is so you won\u2019t pull a muscle .And you should always make sure your body is warmed up. Because so you won\u2019t hurt yourself and your body is warmed up also when you\u2019re doing skills you want to do them correctly because if you don\u2019t you might hurt yourself.\n\nConclusion\n\n\tI hope you liked my book.And what i taught you about was. how to stay safe while you\u2019re doing gymnastics.

million years ago in the late cretaceous time Period and Dromaeosaurus means running lizard? . Raptors are one of the most well known dinosaurs . There are many different species of raptors, they are carnivorous animals, and , each unique body part has a role in keeping them alive.\n\nDifferent Species of Raptors\n\n\tFirst, Raptors are in one kind of family Dromaeosaurus. There were 39 species of dromaeosaurs . Now I am naming 3 . Velociraptor, Microraptor, and Utahraptor. All of the Dromaeosaurus' might had have feathers, even the microraptor could glied. They had feathers, sharp curled claws, and horned teeth.\n\nCarnivorous Animals\n\n\tAdditionally, Raptors hunt differently than other dinosaurs. They have a diet of many dinosaurs and insects, including small reptiles. Raptors eat small dinosaurs like Protoceratops, Struthiomimus, and many more small dinosaurs . Microraptors eat insect because they are small dinos. Bigger raptors can eat small dinos. Raptors hunt in packs so they can take bigger dinos, like diplodocus, triceratops, and brontosaurus. \n\nBody Parts\n\n\tFinally, Raptors have very interesting body parts. Raptor's have claws that help them hunt or kill their prey with. Raptors need to have agile bodys to run and to catch their prey. Also raptors were the same size as a wolf and they were 30 ft long. Underneath all those feathers are holes. Those are the ears. Raptors have good hearing. Maybe they could hear a mile away. A raptor's body is similar to a tyrannosaurus rex.\n\tIn the end, there are many species of raptors, they are carnivores animals, and each unique body part has a role in keeping it alive.Maybe someday when you are grown up, you could solve all the mysteries of the dromaeosaurus.", "doctitle": "04_Maramba_5", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0,

sitting? The food, familyhood, and communication are all interesting topics about gray wolves. Gray wolves are considered endangered, so we should learn more about them to save them.\n\nGray Wolf Food\n\n\tThe diet of a gray wolf is simple. They are carnivores, which means they only eat meat. Gray wolves feed on fish, lizards, snakes, deer, elk, and mouse If they are lucky, they could catch a bird to feed on. Gray wolves feeding on these things helps the environment by stopping these animals from becoming overpopulated.\n\nGray Wolf Familyhood\n\n\tThe familyhood of a gray wolf is like the familyhood of other wolf types. The leader of a pack is a lone male with his mate as a \"second in command\". The other wolves protect and bring food to the leader's and his mate's pups. The pack works together to get food for the pups by surrounding the deer or elk and then attack from all directions.\n\nGray Wolf Communication\n\n\tGray wolf communication consists of whimpering, whining, growning, barking, yelping, and snarling. Gray wolves also use body language to communicate. If a gray wolf is agitated then it might show it's teeth or approach you quickly. If it's unsure or scared then it will put it's tail between it's legs and look at the ground.\n\nConclusion \n\n\tIn conclusion, gray wolf food, familyfood, and communication are all important topics about gray wolves. Gray wolves are also called timber wolves. Gray wolves are endangered, so we must do something to help them.

Grey wolves have been adapting to different weathering over the years. The grey wolf population is over 22,000 wolves and is still increasing. The behavior of a grey wolf is similar to a dog's behavior. Grey wolves have one female and one male to have all the pups.\n\nAdapting\n\nThe grey wolves have been living in a bunch of different places in the world that are really different from each other. some gray wolves live in Europe, but a lot live in Alaska, Canada, and\nAsia. The range of the gray wolf covered over two-thirds of the United States. Now they cover way more than they used to cover.\n\nWolf Numbers\n\nThe population of the grey wolves has increased by a lot over the past 10 years. The grey wolf population has increased by over 20,000 over the past 30 years. Grey wolves were hunted until\nscientists had to take the wolves in and bring the population back up. Now the wolf population is back up on its feet.\n\nWolf Actions\n\nGrey wolves are known to roam around areas up to 12 miles a day. The grey wolves howl if they lose their pack. Grey wolves like to eat horned animals such as deer, elk, and moose. When the grey wolves are successful at catching prey, they don't act civilized.\n\nIn the pack\n\nThere is always one dominant male in the pack of a grey wolves and there is always one female and the dominant male mate and they have all the pups.The whole pack takes care of the pups even though its not their pup. The pack takes care of the pups by giving the pups food, protecting them from other animals, and stays with the pups while the pack goes hunting. Once a pup is two years old it can fend for itself and can start a new pack or stay in the pack it's already in.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you can see the life of a grey wolf is very interesting. These fury fluff balls are helping keep the world balanced. They have adapted to different weathers, and Their population has gone back up.Their actions are very interesting and their lives in the pack are action-packed.(No pun intended.)\n", "doctitle":

The three toed sloth. The three toed sloth eats several different types of food, they live in Central and South American, and has many predators.\n\nFood\n\tThe three toed sloth eats fruit from the cecropia tree to get it's water and nutrients. They also eat small lizards, and carrion. The carrion they eat is like dead flesh. They also eat Buds. Buds is a compact growth on a plant that develops into a leaf, flower, or shoot.\n\nHabitat\nThe tropical forests of Central and South America. They are an arboreal animal which means they live in trees. Descending to the ground only once a week to defecate, They live in the trees and rainforest because their arms are longer than their legs and curved feet for grasping branches.\n\nPredators\n\tThere head turns around in almost in a 360 This allows for greater rotation, which helps the sloth scan for predators like spectacled owls, harpy eagles, and snakes. Sloths to defend themselves are their large claws. If a sloth gets cornered it will hit at the predator with its claws hopefully to wound the predator or scare it away The sloths real defense comes from being unreachable. They do this by staying high up in the trees away from all the action. The most common reasons that sloth is going endangered are Humans and poaching. Humans- Humans are cutting down the red mangrove trees in which the three toed sloth lives in. Because they live in such a small area, this makes it hard for the sloths to survive.\n\nConclusion\nThe three toad sloth eats several different types of food, they live in Central and South American, and have many predators. Don't cut down trees the three toad sloth should not be endangered anymore.\n\nGlossary\ncecropia tree: a large genus of tropical trees that have stems hollow between the nodes and peltate deeply lobed rough leaves usually whitish beneath.\n\ncarrion: The carrion they eat is like dead flesh.

Texas has only 2 national parks, but Sri Lanka's and Texas's national parks are about the same size! Sri Lanka has a lot of different types of food and drinks, animals, and has great places to visit.\n\n\tFirst of all, there are 22 national parks in Sri Lanka, some of them are Yala, Wilpattu, Udawalawe, Bundala, Gal Oya, Minneriya, Horton Plains, and Pigeon Island. They have many protected areas where they have animals and plants that are rare and at risk of extinction. 2.1 people visit Sri Lanka a year and 3/4 of them come to visit the amazing National Parks.\n\n\tSecondly there are 3 main dishes in Sri Lanka. They are rice and curry, string hoppers and hoppers.\nEveryday people eat these meals for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner. Some of the fruits you can get in Sri Lanka (and almost nowhere else in the world) are jackfruit, rambutan, dragonfruit, breadfruit, star fruit and Mangosteen. They all are very nutritious and you can buy them almost anywhere in Sri Lanka. Also, there are many kinds of drinks too. Thambili is a Sri Lankan fruit known as the King Coconut. You can buy this fruit mostly anywhere. You can also put a straw in it and drink the water from it like that, or you can cut it open and pour the juice out into a cup. Some people cut it open to drink the juice but then also eat the \"meat\" or fruit part.\n\n\tAlso, Sri Lanka is known for its tropical forests and all the species that live there. It is mostly known as the home of Asian Elephants, Peacocks, Sloth Bears, Fishing Cats, Leopards, and Monkeys. Some endangered animals are the Fin Whale, Jungle Shrew, Dugong, Fishing Cat, Humpback Whale, Rusty-spotted Cat, Sloth Bear, Sperm Whale, Sri Lankan Giant Squirrel, Sri Lankan Highland Shrew, and the Toque Macaque. They are endangered by illegal logging, illegal hunting, global warming and making buildings where animals could live.\n\n\tThere are many great places to visit when you are there. For example Sigiriya, Royal Botanical Gardens, Galle Rock Fortress, Kandy, and Yala National Park. There are always crowded with many tourists trying to see the beautiful views and animals. But you can go there in the night because it's less crowded and it's still very pretty.\n\n\tIn conclusion Sri Lanka has many different kinds of foods, animals, and great places to visit.

creature whose eyes are bigger than it sbrain? \u201cA stare like no other animal.\u201d well if you don\u2019t know, its a Tarsier. Tarsiers bodys are equipped with a long tail and strong hands.They are carnivores and eat mainly insects. Tarsiers have to stay in trees so their predators don't get them. Their habitats are in the trees of great rainforests and their lives depend on staying away from other creatures. Read this book and you will learn how to save these lovable creatures.\n\n\tThe tarsier is an arboreal nocturnal primate with a stocky body and long tail that is either sparsely covered in fur or has a tuft at the end. They have long and strong hind legs to jump from distances up to 5 meters. The tarsiers eyes are big for catching the little light that they see in the night. The Tarsiers have either have grey, brown, or ochre colored fur depending on the species of the tarsier. There are 13 different types of tarsier but they all have the long tail to cling to something. The hand and feet both have grippy spots on the face of their fingers. The hand has  fingers but, it doesn\u2019t have a thumb.\n\n\tTarsiers diet is made up of mostly insects, but they also eat birds, bats, lizards, and snakes. The tarsier will get it\u2019s prey by jumping on it. The tarsier has to be very patient for its prey. Tarsiers are carnivores and hunt in the trees. The tarsier grabs its prey with its strong hands and holds the prey really tight. Then the tarsier will bite the animal with its forceful jaws.\n\n\tThe tarsier has many predators, but the main predators are civets, arboreal snakes, and monitor lizards. Humans are also big threat to tarsiers because humans are choppping homes of tarsiers down and pulling them in to zoos. Humans also poach tarsiers because of their fur. These threats are killing the species of tarsiers. There is an estimate that are only 5,000 and 10,000 philippine Tarsiers left in the whole world and that number is going down.\n\n\tTarsiers live in South East Asia, Borneo, Sumatra, Bangka, Beitung, Kalimata, and other surrounding islands. The tarsiers live in the trees but sometimes a tarsier will fall to the ground and break a bone. Then a predator can get them.

But looking back we can learn from past wars, specifically the Revolutionary War. The Revolutionary war was a terrible time like all wars. There were many causes that sparked this specific war. There were about 1,500 battles during the war. And the conclusion of the war that went on for eight years and ended in 1783.\n\nHow the War Began\n\tIn the beginning, before the war in 1763, the French and Indian war ended which was the beginning of the Revolutionary War. The aftermath of the French and Indian war left Great Britain in a huge war debt so to pay it off they had to result of making taxes for the American to pay so they could make enough money to pay the debt. These taxes raised sugar and stamps and many more. But the American colonies thought that Britain was using the money to benefit themselves not the Americans. This led to an argument between the colonies leading to the revolutionary war in 1775.\n\nThe Battles of the War\nThe war kicked off on April 19, 1775, in Lexington and Concord. This battle was the first a long battle of skirmishes between the British regulars and the American soldiers for the provincial. The general ordered the British men to capture the colonists to make them surrender their position to the British. The American military lost a lot of supplies either hidden or destroyed, but after the gunfire settled the British lost 273 men and the American lost 95 with this the British retreated. The next battle was on June 17, 1775, the battle of bunker hill. This battle of bunker hill was actually more on breed's hill but the army accidently thought it was bunker hill they were fighting on. It started when the British wanted to get an advantage on the Americans by capturing two hills. But the American found out and led an attack on the British army. The British lost around 260 men and there were 800 wounded on the battlefield.\n\nThe Conclusion of the War\n\tThe terrifying war started to come to an end in 1781 when the American army captured the general of the British army and forced him to give up their territory. Later about two years in 1783 the generall and the treaty of Paris made an announcement America finally became independent and was free from the British.\n\n\tAs you see this war was terrible but in return, America got its independence. From the beginning to the hundreds of battles across the war, to the conclusion of the great battle. This war left with America changed forever and reshaped for the better of everyone. Imagine what life in America would be like if we didn't have independence and didn't have a war?", "doctitle": "05_Campanile_11", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 33.0, "average": 2.75, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.5, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.5, "elaboration": 3.0, "craft": 3.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "Good job laying out the structure here", "transitions": "", "ending": "nice job leaving us with a thought ...

field at once in one game! Rugby is a great sport because of all the positions, all of the defensive plays and most of all, because of the tackling.\r\n \r\nOne reason that rugby is a great sport is because of all the positions. One reason is that, according to ruck.co.uk there are 15 players one side at once. Secondly, some of the positions are hocker, prop, and left wing and these are all part of a scrum. Lastly, all positions help the team and some of the most important ones are scrum half because he/she puts the all in during the scrum another is prop the prop sets up the scrum.\r\n \r\nAnother reason that rugby is a great sport is because of the defensive plays. One reasonable thing to do is, to tackle the player you have to put your shoulder down and go under the waist. To add on,according to rugby coach weekly you could miss pass in a scrum. One last thing is, there is a pressure winder. What happens is you hold the position with dummy runners to move their winger to defence line.\r\n \r\nAlthough rugby is a great sport because of all the positions and because of the defensive plays especially rugby is a great sport because of the tackling. Firstly, according to rugby how you can only tackle the ball carrier. The again, you can only talk in the play of field. The last thing, the ball carrier must be being held or the bell carter is not tackled.\r\n \r\nIn conclusion rugby is a great sport because of all the positions, because of the defensive plays, and most of all, because of the tackling. I think ruby is an amazing sport and you should play at any chance you can.

Asthma is a big issue. It is a big issue because there is asthma attacks, there\u2019s special treatments, and most of all, because my family and friends have asthma.\n \nOne reason asthma is a big issue is that there is asthma attacks. For example, when it starts your airwaves get narrower and it gets hard to breath. You usually have to go to the hospital and get a oxygen mask to get air in your lounges. To add on, the disease will happen when you are being to active, idt hurts your lounges and leaves you without breath.\n \nAnother reason is, there is special treatments. My evidence for this is, you need to use and inhaler which puffs salbutamol which is a medication that helps you control your breathing and gives you oxygen so you can breath. Also, you can\u2019t be active with sports or you just have to use the inhaler 30 minutes before in the middle and at 30 minutes after. Also, basketball, soccer, and sports that have a lot of running are not a good choice.\n \nAlthough asthma is a big issue because there are asthma attacks, the treatments, especially because, my family and friends have asthma. My first example is, my cousin has bronchitis and her asthma makes it even worse. Also, my friend plays softball and she uses an inhaler 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after. And she has to play catcher because it doesn\u2019t have a lot of running like outfield and other positions. In conclusion, asthma is a big issue because of the asthma attacks, the treatments, and most of all because, my family and friends have asthma. I think doctors should find a way to get rid of asthma.

America was still recovering from the Great Depression and jobs increased by 96%. The invasion of Poland, America going to war, the fall of France, invasion of China, D-Day, the american island hopping campaign, and the Japanese and German surrender were all important events in World War two.\n \nInvasion of Poland\n \nWorld War Two started when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France were enraged when Germany invaded Poland so they immediately went to war. At 4:45 a.m. 1.5 million Nazi troops crossed the border of Poland. The German air force or Luftwaffe bombed Polish airfields and planes while German U-boats and the German fleet suppressed the Polish navy. The Nazi leader Adolf Hitler claimed the attack was a defensive action. But Britain and France were not convinced. America was still a neutral country at the time but, that would not last for long.\n \nAmerica Goes to War\n \nOn December 7, 1941 at 8:00 a.m. six Japanese aircraft carriers launched 353 planes to attack Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. All eight American battleships were damaged unfortunately four of them were destroyed beyond repair. America was completely unaware of the attack and immediately scrambled all available fighters and anti aircraft guns. Nearly 20 American naval ships, 300 planes, and sadly more than 2,400 American people either died or were destroyed in the attack. The day after the attack President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan, Congress agreed.\n \nThe Fall of France\n \nWith 800,000 troops in their military force France was thought to have the strongest infantry force in europe. But the French defense depended heavily on the Maginot line for protection against a German attack. The defensive consisted of giant pill boxes and other defenses. The French had 41 divisions supporting or manning it. The Germans prepared 1,500,000 troops and 1,500 tanks to strike at the Maginot line. They planned to strike at the weakest point were only 12 infantry divisions and 4 cavalry divisions stood. But the Dutch army sent 10 divisions totaling 400,000 troops. When the germans attacked the French and Dutch were taken by surpise and fell back. As Germany pushed forward the French and Dutch fell back even more and led to the fall of France.\n \nThe Invasion of China\n \nOn July 7, 1937 Japanese troops invaded China. At the time the Chinese army was inferior and was still using World War one weapons. They could not withstand the attack and were forced to retreat. Japanese planes bombed many Chinese cities and reduced them to ruble. China tried to stop the raids by sending biplanes into the sky but were just torn apart by japanese airplanes. America sent reinforcements to try and deal with the raids but they were too small and were overwhelmed by the japanese planes. The raids continued while japanese ground forces attacked cities help by the Chinese. The raids and ground force attacks led to the capture and occupation of China.\n \nD-Day\n \nOn June 6, 1944 156,000 American, British, and Canadian soldiers invaded German occupied France from five beachheads code named: Utah beach, Omaha beach, Gold beach, Juno beach, and Sword beach. America invaded the Omaha and Utah beachheads. While Great Britain invaded Sword and Gold. So Canada was left to attack Juno. Many soldiers were lost in operation Overlord. The beachhead Omaha was a very tough beach to capture because the Germans had built gigantic pill boxes, hundreds of landing craft obstacles, barbed wire, large concrete walls, and landmines. The vehicles used in the battle were M4 tractors, Crusader gun tractors, Crusader AA Mk 3s, Universal Bren carriers, Half track M3s, Kangaroo APCs, SdKfz Pumas, SdKfz 250s, Jeep Willys, Dodge WC 51-52s, Bedford MWDs, Schwimmwagens, K\u00fcbelwagen 82s, Chevrolet G-7100s, GMC CCKW 353s, and the Opel Blitz 36-7600As. The Allies won normandy and went on to take back France.\n \nThe American Island Hopping Campaign\n \nOn February 1945 70,000 American troops invaded Iwo Jima. A few weeks before that American planes bombed the island. That was going to be the strategy for the rest of the \"Island Hopping\". As the soldiers attacked enemy positions M4 Sherman tanks provided cover for the soldiers. Soldiers had special weapons and abilities such as shock troopers which were troopers tasked with leading an assault, Flametroopers which were tasked with burning the Japanese out of their positions, Assault troopers which were regular troopers, and paratroopers which were special forces troopers that parachuted out of an aircraft usually at around 800 feet. After Iwo Jima came Okinawa. Okinawa was the one of the islands were the U.S. lost a lot of soldiers. As the bombers attacked, the troops prepared their plan. 180,000 American soldiers attacked the beaches of Okinawa on April 1, 1945. Enemy soldiers were dug into mountains and hills. To deal with this the American flame troopers shot their fire into the caves and burned the enemies out of their positions. After multiple key islands were taken the Americans consider themselves to be at \"Japan's doorstep\". Americans started to raid Japanese cities. The \"Doolittle Raid\" was conducted by James Doolittle himself. Meanwhile at the American homeland scientists were developing a nuclear weapon which was being tested in Arizona. That would be the key to the japanese surrender.\n \nThe Japanese and German Surrender\n \nIn Europe the German surrender was short and simple they surrendered and everything went back to normal although they were striped of most of their army. In the Pacific they were still fighting. After testing they dropped the weapon two times. On Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Devasted by the attack Japan immediately surrendered. the bombs crippled the cities and left lots of radioactiveness. That harmed the people living there.\n \nConclusion\n \nIn conclusion World War two was a horrible conflict that taught America one thing The world should never go to war again. The invasion of Poland, American going to war, The fall of France, The invasion of China, D-Day, The American island hopping campaign, and The Japanese and German surrender where all important events that we learned from so that we could negotiate instead of fighting.\n \nWorld war two lasted for six years. Many people were lost in the war. The world should never go to war again.\n \nGlossary\n \nNazi A german political group.\nU-boat A german submarine.\nAnti-aircraft gun Anti-aircraft guns are weapons designed to attack aircraft.

What they eat, how there pack works.\n\nAll about Grey Wolves\n\nOnce grey wolves wound rome the great Yousemity valley and the rocky mountsains, to the coast lines and the mountain deserts. But wolves were hunted nearly to extinction because they would attack mushers sled dogs even though they arrely attack humans. Many grey wolves were poisoned, shot and trapped for this deed.\n\nDiet of a grey wolf\n\nGrey wolves have large range of foods on their diet . The most preferred food source is large hooved animals such as caribou, elk, moose but they will eat beaver,mice as well as plants and berries. Grey wolves need there pack to hunt.\n\nThe Pack of Wolf \n\nA wolf pack ranges from 7 to 8 wolves including a Father (pack Leader) Mother and offsprings. A wolf pack communicates through howls and howl most when there is a full moon. Wolves also communicate by yapping gralying snarls,barking. The mother and father of a wolf pack are the ones to breed a liter of 9 to 12 pups.\n\nWolves are some of the most beautiful animals in north America. Wolves can do things that can never imagine doing like eating raw meat, travelling around 12 miles each day or smelling a person from 3 miles of range in a forest with all sorts of smells! So remember that a wolf is not a fujoshis blood thirsty killing machine but instead a beautiful piece of art with feelings just like we do.\n\n", "doctitle": "04_Kalvakolanu_10", "grades":

"plaintext": "Orca Whales\n\nHave you ever heard of an Orca, AKA the \u201cKiller Whale\u201d? Killer Whales are huge, a whoping 3,000 lbs! Killer Whales and Orcas are amazing and I would like to prove it.\n\nThe Body Of The Beast\n\nOrcas have a very cool body structure, that structure can be up to 23ft long! First off we have a Orcas tooth. An Orca tooth is very sharp, don\u2019t touch it! On the other hand, the Orca has smooth skin, where as a sharks skin is like sandpaper! But we\u2019re not talking about sharks though. A Orca has a blow hole to breath. It can hold its breath for hours.\n\nDiet\n\nA Orca is a apex-preadtor, which means it has no natral enimies. A Orca is also a carnivore which means it only eats meat for example, fish, penguins, young whales, seals, moose, and even sharks if neseseary.\n\nHabitat\n\nA Orca lives in the Picific, Antartic, and Artic oceans. They meet up in packs and migrate together. From pole to pole every year.\n\nOrcas in Captivity\n\nYou can even see Orcas just in the wild\u2026 but in captivity too! Sea World has orginized a program where Orcas \u201cpreform\u201d with stunt divers that do tricks on them and the Orcas do tricks themselves! The Orcas are not bothered by this, some even like it!\n\nFun Facts\n\nHere are some facts you might not know about Orca Whales.\n1. An Orca is a type of dolphin\n2. The Scientific name for a Orca is Orcinus orca\n3. Orcas can even be completley white which is super rare!\n\nConclusion\n\nOrca whales are truly astonishing beautiful animals. I encourage you to go to Sea World in San Diego CA and see them in captivity! Or go whale watching and see them in the wild.

If you have you\u2019ll find out the answer in Oh, abot 5 seconds.\n\nPARTS OF A SADDLE\n\nA saddle has quite a few parts, but some of the easiest/simplest parts are: the horn, the seat, the stirrups, the gurth. There are also some helpful things like a halter & riens. These things each have a use. ex.\nThe seat = To sit on, obviously\nThe horn = I use it to hold onto sometimes\nthe stirrup = for your feet so you have a better grip on your horse\nthe gurth = to hold the saddle on your horse\nThe riens = to control your horse\nThe halter = to connect your lead rope & riens to.\n\nTools\nIn horse back riding there are some tools that help. For example a crop which is a stick about two feet long with a piece of leather on the bottom which you hit the horse in the butt with to get it to go faster or listen to you. There is also a whip, which is basically the same as a crop. A whip is a stick with a long piece of rope on the bottom that you \u201cCrack the whip\u201d with. If your wondering where the heck the expression crack the whip came from its because when you swing the whip at the ground it sounds like someones cracking a piece of wood.\n\nI hope you learned some new facts or information. P.S. If you enjoyed this book/essay I encourage you to try out horseback riding, it\u2019s super fun!\n\nSighned,\nyour friend", "doctitle": "08_Stoddard_9", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "",

Did you know that Dogs don\u2019t always get along when you want them to so get them as a puppy so you can get a trainer. Plus you get some free time to yourself!\n\nDogs are loyal and good hunters.  Some love water, some don\u2019t.  I know for a fact they love food and water.  You should give lots of love to your dog and he or she will do the same for you.  You can train your dog to find people\u2019s belongings and other things.  Dogs have teeth to rip meat of bones, nose to smell the scent of a dog for over a mile away wow, they have great ears for hearing, and they have great eyesight. Dogs go way back in history like before romans ruled. Dogs I think came from wolves. Some people\u2019s stories say that foxes come from the dog family, but they come from the cat family. You should give your dog training if there is a break in and when the burglars break in \u2026 GRRRR!  Your dog will go caching the burglars. If your dog is not going to catch the burglars, you might hear a gunshot. Also you should feed and walk your dog every day. you do one cup of food soft or hard.\n\nWhen you dog is sick you should take it to the vet for a check up to see what your dog might have. You might need to wait outside of the office while your dog is getting a check up. They might give your dog a treat or two if you are ok with it.  If your does bites you will have to put a muzzle on your dog\u2019s nose to keep your dog from biting the vet.\n\nThat is why i wanted to teach you about dogs. Thank you for reading my book.

But Love Birds need a decent size cage, a water bottle, (for birds) multiple perches that are diferent sizes and tectures and, three to four toys not to many 5+ or to low 3- because if there is to little that could actully make them sick but if there is too many they will feal cramed and not safe.\n\nIf you are wondering if you are going to get a love bird first think about this Love Birds are escape artists! but there are some ways to Prevent that use a little clip on the door of the cage and put some cool things in its cage so it will only want to come out of its cage when you need it too And Love Birds are NOT shoulder Birds they would rather sit on the back of your shoulder, on you back or, on you head, noone knows why but thats OK! Love Birds are great for kids but heres something to think about don\u2019t buy two only buy one because if you buy two it will be agresive to you or the other bird which is not good. But so the bird gets used to you take it out a lot!\n\nLove birds need a certain tempature that is good for them it can\u2019t be hot nor cold 65-70 degrees \u00ba farenhight and it will get sick in hot or cold weather so just in the middle. And a love bird will be agresive till it finds someone it likes, and it will give you a light peck if it likes you so don\u2019t buy two so it won\u2019t like you. And love birds are usally 40-50 dollars + the cage and food and toys.\n\nI hope you still want to get a love bird like me but still think about what is going to happen if you get one like it escaping.

If you want to learn more this Narrative is perfect for you.  I will be teaching you about: Mario\u2019s moveset, Luigi\u2019s moveset, and Donkey Kong\u2019s moveset.\n\nMario is the first character you will find in Super Smash Bros.  His moves don\u2019t rely on ranged attacks.  But he does have a famous move called the \u201cforward aerial\u201d, this move can spike character\u2019s off stage which can K.O at 0.00%.  This move can be performed by pressing A in the air.  Mario has a move where he shoots a fireball out of his fist, this move can be performed by pressing B. Mario\u2019s final Smash is called \u201cMario finale\u201d, you can perform this move By pressing B with the Smash ball.\n\nLuigi\u2019s moveset is much different then mario\u2019s moveset, Luigi is actually harder to use than Mario.  Luigi\u2019s final Smash is called \u201cPoltergust G-00\u201d you can use this move by pressing B with the Smash ball.  Luigi\u2019s down taunt is the only taunt that can attack.  It lifts characters up which does some damage.  If you are on the edge of the stage and the opponent is holding on the ledge, try your down taunt and they will get spiked.  Luigi has a move called \u201cGreen missile\u201d this move can be shown by pressing the control stick left or right, and pressing B in the process.  This move can be charged by holding B too.\n\nDonkey Kong is a very strong character.  And he has the equivalent of 4 spikes.  Donkey Kong\u2019s has a move called \u201cSpinning Kong\u201d this move let\u2019s donkey kong spin, you can adjust the angle by tilting left or right you can perform this move by pressing B.  Plus You can use this move on the ground which spin\u2019s Donkey Kong in a flurry of punches.  Donkey Kong\u2019s final smash is called \u201cJungle Rush\u201d you can use this move by pressing B with the smash ball.\n\nI hope enjoyed this Narrative and what I taught you about For example: Mario\u2019s moveset, Luigi\u2019s moveset, and etc. For more information visit \u201cSmashpedia FANDOM\u201d.", "doctitle": "05_Karr_3", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 30.5, "average": 2.54, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 2.5, "ending": 2.5, "organization": 3.5, "elaboration": 3.0, "craft": 2.5, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "Good job organizing & staying on subject", "elaboration": "Good use of examples.

football? If you do than this book will tell you about the gear you need, where to practise/where the games are and the rules.\n \nPractise/where to play\n        \tOnce you sign up for flag you will need to go to the practice which are every week. You will also practise before games. My team name is the Trojans. We practise at French Park. you can also practice at home. But to practise at home you will need a  big grassy area.The games are Damen Garcia. Damen Garcia is across the street from the yons shopping center.\n \nGear\n        \tThe Gear you will need  will be  provided. You will be given a jersey  and a belt to use. You will have to bring your own cleats. You must wear black shorts with no pockets. Most people wear soccer shorts because they play soccer and the soccer shorts are what the refs prefer. Your coach will have the balls. If you want you can use football gloves but you can\u2019t use baseball gloves. You will also need a mouthguard. You can buy mouthguards at Target, Dicks, and Big 5. You can also get a case for your mouthguard.\n \nRules\n        \tThere can only be six players on the field playing at a time. The quarterback, hiker and four other players. When you are on defence the person who is going to rush needs to be behind the marker. If you are 10 or less yards away from the endzone you can not run the ball. It has to be a pass.\n \nConclusion\n        \tIf you want to play flag football then you already know the basic information. Today you learned what gear you will need, where to practice/where to play and the rules. A tip i have for you is to not stop until you hear the whistle.\n", "doctitle": "06_Ibarguen_4", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "Grammar was fine.", "score": {"total": 27.0, "average": 2.25, "criteria": {"overall": 2.5, "lead": 2.5, "transitions": 2.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.5, "craft": 2.5, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 1.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "Informative paper", "lead": "Question and told the reader what they'd be teaching", "transitions": "Not many transitions", "ending": "Restated the subconcepts and added a tip at the end", "organization": "Organized and informative", "elaboration": "Text features would really add to this.

In this book you will be reading about, what is a challenge, Don\u2019t fall into the wrong pool, human kerplunk.  Don\u2019t push the wrong box, and don\u2019t cut the wrong rope.  So I hope you enjoy my book about challenges.\n\nAre you wondering about what is a challenge?  If you are this is the right book or chapter for you.  A challenge is a game that one of you \u201csays I challenge you to a arm ressle\u201d.  Or something else like that.  Another challenge your friend might say is \u201cI challenge you for a warhead challenge.  Those are some challenges you might have fun with.  You can challenge your friend to like when you get older you can have a boxfort challenge.  If you still want to learn more about challenges keep reading and you will learn more.\n\nThis challenge is really fun because you can see your friend or family member fall into something gross like slime or water with glitter and a little bit of slime.  How to play this challenge is you pick some people and you get 3 mattress and. One person is going to have a pool of something in side of it like what I said before or it can just be a mattress.  Maybe you should bring a pair of cloughs just in case you fall into the pool.  The reason why is because you do not want to be stuck in the same wet cloughs for the rest of the day.\n\nThis is another good challenge because on a hot day you can use water balloons and that is always refreshing.  So if you are wondering how to play this challenge it is very easy but you might want to make your own kerplunk because the original might not work very well.  How to play.  First you have to pick a partner.  Then you will have to find out who is going to go under the water balloons and you don\u2019t want the water balloons to fall on your partner and get the most sticks.  Then it will be the other persons turn to go.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my book.  I got this idea from youtube.  Her channel is so cassie and she did all of these challenges on her channel.  And maybe you will do those challenges with some friends.

Well I\u2019m here to tell you that.  It was the Chumash Indians!!!  They used wonderful tomals, tule huts, and the malametepupi that you\u2019re going to learn about.  Let\u2019s learn about the tomals that they used!\n\nTomals were very useful for the Chumash.  The way the chumash built them is very cool.  They used redwood for the tomals, but redwood came from a different part of california, so the Chumash couldn\u2019t just go get it.  What happend, is that the redwood would fall and go into a river, and the river would carry the redwood down a stream and it would go to the Chumash.  Soon the Chumash would start building.  First, they would have to cut the would into planks.  Then they would use tar to hold it together.  Luckly, redwood swells so the water wouldn\u2019t go into the tomal, it would go into the wood.  Tomals are boats.  The Chumash would call them houses of the sea.  Tomals were used in many different ways.  One way they used tomals is for fishing.  The Chumash would go out into the ocean and fish.  Another use for the is for trading.  They would trade shells and beads.  All in all, tomals were very useful and was made very interestingly.  Now going on to the tule hut station.\n\nTule huts were the Chumash\u2019s houses (on land).  They were built amazingly.  The Chumash used willow poles to outline the houses and used hand made ropes to keep them together.  Then they would get tules and put them on top of the willow poles to cover them.  The Chumash left a hole at the top so when they light a fire in the house, the smoke would go out, after the fire and, they would cover it with animal skin.  The next thing they had to do for their houses was make the door.  They used whale bones they found and out lined the door, then they would cover the door with animal skin.  That was their amazing tule huts/houses.  Now for the malametepupi.\n\nThe malametepupi was like a chumash playground (m-A-lamentapupi).  The malametepupi as outlined with round rocks that were in a circle.  There were games to play in the malametepupi, like hoop and shoot.  Here\u2019s how to play hoop and shoot.  You need a stick, the Chumash used a spear, a cylinder and a partner.  Your partner needs to roll the cylinder where the open part is facing you, while your partner is rolling, you try to shoot the stick into the hoop, which is the cylinder.  Then you switch.  This game was designed to help young boys learn to hunt.  As you can see, the malametepupi was amazing.\n\nNow our time together must come to an end.  We learned about the useful tomals, the amazing tule huts, and the fun malametepupi.

Soccer is a fun sport because you can play different positions, you can make cheers for your team, and most of all because soccer can teach you important life lessons.\n \n        \tOne reason soccer is a fun sport is that you can play different positions. For example, defence is one position. The defence position where people stay back and health the goalie defend their goal. Also, forward is a position too. Forward is the people who usually score goals for their team. Lastly, goalie is another position. Goalies defend their goal but goalies are the only person who can use their hands to grab the ball.\n \n        \tAnother reason soccer is fun is that you can make up cheers for your team. To start off with, in the site Soccer Cheers, it says cheers help you team feel confident in what their doing. To add on also in the site Soccer Cheers, it keeps players pepped up and focused on doing their best. Finally, one example of cheer is, \u201cwe don\u2019t wear bows and skirts, we only wear soccer shirts! We don\u2019t play with baby dolls, we only kick soccer balls! GO (your teams name)!\u201d\n \n        \tAlthough soccer is a fun sport because you can play different positions and because you can make up cheers especially soccer is a fun sport because soccer can teach you important life lessons. One example is from the site 6 Life Lessons Your Child Can Learn From Soccer it says teamwork is a life lesson because soccer requires a great deal of teamwork. In addition also from the site 6 Life Lessons Your Child Can Learn From Soccer, it states hard word is an important life lesson because alongside teamwork, soccer teaches that the only sure path to success is through hard work. To conclude this paragraph again from the site 6 Life Lessons Your Child Can Learn From Soccer, it says setting goals is an important life lesson because there is a lot of things soccer players do that can be measured by setting goals.\n \n        \tIn conclusion, soccer is a fun sport because you can play different positions, you can make up cheers for your team, and most of all, because soccer can teach you important life lessons.

You start feeling sick, your head hurts, you feel like you are going to die.  That feeling is anxiety.  There are a lot of things about anxiety.  And you are going to learn what triggers anxiety, what it feels like, and how to deal with it.  It is important to know about anxiety so you can know how to deal with it and prevent it.\n\nDid you know there are a lot of events that can trigger anxiety?  One of those ways is parties or social events.  The reason for this is if people don\u2019t know each other than you don\u2019t know what they are like.  They could have gone to jail.  Or you could be thinking that something really bad is going to happen.  Like you can think that there could be a shooting.  Or you could get hurt badly.  Another thing that could trigger anxiety is negative thinking.  What I mean is that you think bad about yourself or other things.  Like you could put yourself down and say \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d  Another way you could think badly is saying stuff is to hard or saying bad things about yourself.  Also you could think badly by saying other things are bad and then that will just get you angry as well.  Lastly a thing that could trigger anxiety is worries.  The reason for this is when you worry you over think and it could lead to you making stuff worse than it already is and you could make your worries even worse witch means you making you anxiety worse.\n\nYou are about to go and present.  You are feeling super nervous and maybe even start giving up hope because of how nervous you feel.  Anxiety can feel like a lot of things.  One of those things is it could be difficult to do stuff.  Why you may ask.  Because you are having so much anxiety that you are stressing out and you are thinking that you have so many things to do and you are just sitting around picking stuff up and putting it down.  Another feeling you might feel is crying out of nowhere.  This is because you are having so much feelings and you just don\u2019t know what to do so you could just start crying.  Lastly you could feel Lack of confidence.  You could feel this because you have a lot in your head and if you\u2019re slower than other people you could feel no confidence in yourself.  Also you could just not be that good and you aren\u2019t trying and you are saying \u201cI\u2019m not good at it.\u201d\n\nDid you know there are ways you could deal with anxiety right in front of you.  One way you could deal with it is going to counseling.  Doing this will let you talk about it and you will let everything out of your head and it will feel like you won\u2019t have to deal with it anymore.  Another way you could deal with anxiety is replacing negative thoughts with good thoughts.  For example, if your friend didn\u2019t want to be your friend anymore and the way she said it was stuck in your head all day you could think about it like this you can more friends that might be better than your old one.  Lastly a way you could deal with it is yoga.  Let my explain, if you are doing yoga your mind will be focused on that and not your anxiety.  Also yoga can be a new hobby and instead of worrying you could learn more stuff about yoga and focus on that.  Also it could feel like you\u2019re sweating you\u2019re anxiety away.\n\nNow that you know a lot about anxiety you should be able to tell your friends about it if they ever have it.  You could tell them about what triggers anxiety, what it feels like, and how to deal with it.  I think anxiety is a weird thing that most people have and a lot of people struggle with.

Math is more important in life than you think. Math is always written differently, well you see it written differently because if you saw a rubik\u2019s cube you might think it\u2019s just colors but it has a bunch of patterns. You might think that math is just a paper and a pencil and that\u2019s right? No, you can do it in your head, with apples and bananas, and with a chalkboard and chalk. Math isn\u2019t just a fun hobby, it stretches you brain, as my dad once said, \u201cWhen you do math a lot your brain will expand.\u201d You\u2019ll learn about how math it\u2019s written, it can be done anywhere and it stretches your brain. In the following paragraph you\u2019ll learn about different ways math is written.\n\nMath is written in different ways. When you write it in one way people might not understand you, but if you write it in two or three ways someone will understand you better. An example of this is, when you use the Traditional Algorithm to solve a math equation, someone might not understand you. If you use the Traditional Algorithm and the Number Line someone might understand you better. Another example of this is when you use a chalkboard and chalk people might that is how to do math, but if you\u2019re solving a rubik;s cube and you that\u2019s math, then it still is. By comparison, it\u2019s like saying, math is only numbers on paper when you can use apples and bananas. To sum it up, math is done way differently than you think.\n\nMath is done everywhere and anywhere. You might think you can only do math at school and home, but imagine being on a car ride (like me) and it is 4 hours long (like me) and there is nothing to do except math. Well that happened to me. I was sick of doing anything, but back to you, as you can see when you\u2019re bored you can just think of all the wonderful places to do math, not just your home and your school. In conclusion, you can\u2019t just do math in some spaces, you can do it in all places.\n\nMath also stretches your brain. If you do it repeatedly every day for your whole life you\u2019ll be extremely good at math. An example of this is when you are trying to work on an equation and you finally solve it it\u2019s like trying to cut down a tree (don\u2019t try to do that) and after a year of cutting, you finally get the tree down. Also, if you\u2019re constantly solving a rubik\u2019s cube you will get faster at it (if you\u2019re doing it right.) In conclusion, when you are doing math your brain gets bigger on the inside not the outside.\n\nTo sum it up, when you do math a lot of good things happen, your brain stretches, you do it at places, and you write it in different ways. When you do it in different ways, you;ll learn more ways. And if you do it a lot, your brain will stretch. If you don\u2019t believe me then go try these things all by yourself. I think that when I do math all of these things come to my mind.

Contents\nIntroduction.......3\nEquipment........4\nStrocks........5\nExercise.......6\nConclusion.......7\n\nIntroduction\nWait you don't know how to swim well today I am going to teach you how but the first you need to know about swimming is the equipment you need ,the strokes and the exercise. That is what I am going to teach you today. Did you know that Swimmers sweat in the pool I know it\u2019s crazy. If you already know al ot about swimming there will probably be a lot of things you might not know.\n\nEquipment\nYou might think that all you need in order to swim is a swimsuit but you actually need more than just a swimsuit, You need a pull buoy, swim cap, kickboard. These thing matter because the kick board works out your legs The reason you need them is you need to learn how to kick your legs to swim faster. The pull buoy workout your arms because it prevents you from kicking your legs so you can only use your arms to swim. Another important equipment you need are google\u2019s the reason you need them is because you need to see under water unless you want to burn you eyes from chlorine or run in two another person But I think you don\u2019t want to do that.\n\nStrocks\nDid you know that hair creates friction in the water? Because I didn\u2019t. Do you have a friend that does swimming and they are always talking about the strokes and you don\u2019t know what they are talking about. In this Paragraph I am going to teach you about the different types of strokes so you won\u2019t be confused next time. My favorite one is freestyle and you might be thinking What does \u201cfreestyle\u201d mean well is a type of stroke where you swing your arms in a circle motion and kick your legs. Butterfly is a stroke where you swing your arms like a butterfly\u2019s wings and you take a breath out of the water everytime you swing your arms. Backstroke is a stroke where you float on your back while kicking your legs and swing your arms in the same motion as the freestyle.\n\nExercise\nAre you looking forward to lose weight well the best stroke to lose wright is Freestyle because you are working and testing your limits in each part of your body. A 130-pound person swimming freestyle for one hour will burn 590 calories swimming fast, and 413 calories swimming slower. A 155-pound person swimming freestyle for one hour will burn 704 calories swimming fast, and 493 calories swimming slower. You would be fit after that.\n\nConclusion\nDo you know more about swimming after you read my writing? I hope you did! Now you know the equipment you need, the strokes, and how you can exercise. Swimming can be for the elderely and young people. Now I am going to give you a test. Are you ready\n\n1. What are the strokes?\n2. What Equipment do you need to swim?\n3. How much calories would 130 pound person burn?\nI hoe you got them all right. The answer will be in the slide below\n\nTest answers\n1. Backstroke, freestyle, butterfly\n2. Kickboard, pull boue, googles, swimsuil, swim cap\n3. 590 calories\nIn my opinion I love swimming. It is my favorite Sport and after reading this book and trying swimming. You might love it as much as I do.", "doctitle": "01_Medina-Kim_05", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 28.0, "average": 2.33, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 1.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.5, "craft": 2.5, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "Nice job speaking to the reader", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 146, "end_index": 154, "old_text": "Wait you", "new_text": "Wait!

Introduction\n2. Different bikes\n3. Hardest trail\n4. Red bull rampage\n5. Conclusion\n\nDo you seek thrill and beautiful sights well if you do then mountain biking is perfect for you. In this I will teach you about different bikes, the hardest trails and red bull rampage.\n\nDifferent bikes\nDo you have a mountain bike? Well I do of course mountain bikes can be fun just bombing hill they can also be fun by going of jumps and wooden features. There are two types of mountain bikes, hardtail and downhill bikes. Hardtail are really sturdy but are very heavy compared to downhill bikes which aren\u2019t very sturdy but have amazing shocks.\n\nHardest trail\nDid you know that Robbie Maddison (a pro mountain biker) went of a 1875 ft drop on a mountain bike. The hardest public mountain bike park is moab, Utoh. Moab has technical turns, hard climbs and big jumps.\n\nRED BULL RAMPAGE\nFun fact: read red bull rampage has been around for 18 years. There 18 riders that participate in the red bull rampage. THe rules: before the event each rider will design there trail and have a team go out onto mountain and create the trail. The riders will then will have three turns and the only run that counts is the one that you get the most points you earn points by having soft and smooth landing and cool tricks.\n\nConclusion\nFun fact: \u201cOne of the first known models of a mountain bike was back in 1896, where bicycles were modified for \u201coff-road\u201d use by Buffalo Soldier from Montana to Yellowstone in the United States.\u201d https://interestingfacts.tv .

Well cats are awesome and there are many types of cats. They also eat different kinds of foods and show interesting behaviors. I hope you enjoy reading this paper on cats.\n\nBreeds of cats\nThere are many breeds of cats in the world. Three popular types are himalayan, Siamese and manx/ First, himalayans have a beautiful long, thick body of fur. The most popular color of a himalayan cat are white, gray or a combination of gray and white. Himalayas are beautiful but need a lot of grooming, because they shed.There is also the Siamese breed. This cat is special because it has beautiful, light blue eyes. Also, all Simaese are born with a white coat of fur but when they get older their ears, face, feet, and tail turn dark colors. Last, there is the manx. This cat is very different because it was born without a tail. However, some manxes have a little tiny tail called a stump and the ones born with tails are called rumpies. As you can see there are many different breeds of cats!\n\nDiet\nHave you ever fed a cat? Well cats need a well balanced diet. Cats need to have water available at all times. Water can be left out so they can drink when they need to. Cats need to have crunchy food to help keep their teeth clean and give them vitamins. Cats can also be given wet food. Wet food comes in many different flavors. If your cat is picky you can find a flavor for them. Wet food should only be given once a day of day.\n\nBehaviors\nCats can show different kinds of behavior. Some cats can be aggressive. They might chase and hiss or growl when close to other cats or dogs. Other cats may not be aggressive and enjoy hanging out with other pets. Also cats can be very lazy. For example, my cat likes to lay down and chill in the sun. Last, cats are excellent hunters. If you have a mouse they will find it, kill it and bring it to you and show you what a great hunter he is. Cats have interesting behaviors.\n\nConclusion \nIn conclusion people should have a cat because they are awesome pets! There are many different breeds of cats, they are easy to care for, and each has its own unique behavior.

Rabbits are cool animals because the desert rabbit uses its big ears by blocking off heat. In this book I will teach you about rabbits and the food they eat, what they need, and different types of rabbits.\n\nFood\nDo you ever wonder the different types of food rabbits eat ? I was researching and found that, \u201cbaby rabbits should be given alfalfa, and adult rabbits should be fed timothy hay, gradd hay, or oat hay.\u201d according to wikipedia. They also eat clover, basil, bok choy, broccoli, carrot tops, celery, collard greens, and hay.\n\nWhat they need\nRabbits need a lot of things like they need water to keep them hydrated and they need food to keep them healthy and a sleter to keep them safe. Why rabbits need these things is because it\u2019s how you take care of a rabbit and that\u2019s how you would take care of any other pet\u2019s.\n\nDifferent types of rabbtits\nThere are a lot of different types of rabbit. For example there are there is a Tapeti pygmy rabbit, Eastern, Cottontail netherland, Flemish giant rabbit, Holland lop, Mini lop, Rex rabbit, American rabbit, Polish rabbit, Checkered giant rabbit. THere\u2019s more rabbits in the world but that\u2019s just to name a few.\n\nConclusion\nI hope you liked learning about rabbits with me like what they need the food they eat and different types rabbits .

On-Demand\n\nVolleyball\n\nIntroduction\nHey do you play volleyball? Well on this very piece of paper I will tell you how to play volleyball, (and rules go along with it), where you can play volleyball, and why it is fun. Keep on reading to learn more and more.\n\nHow to play Volleyball\nHow to play volleyball, well you have to learn about hitting, passing, and the court. Lets first get on to hitting, there are lots of different types of hitting, for example you can spike, where you throw the ball into the air and give a big high five. Or there is setting where you where you make a triangle out of your two hands using your pointer finger and your thumb and trying to throw the ball over the net. Or there is serving where you hold the ball down low in one hand and then your other hand, you do knuckles and then swing and... HIT! Not only that but we have to go to passing you can set or you can held out both of your hands and put them on top of each other and then bring your thumbs in. Now you have to learn the rules of the court. There is almost like a big triangle or diamond on the court there is 1 person in front 2 people on a side and 1 in the back. After both teams have served then you rotate the one on the right side goes out and the other person comes in, but if there is no people in line then you just rotate around the whole thing.\n\nWhere?\nOne of the best places to play volleyball are U.S.Y.V.L the are one of the best places to go because the games are on the weekends and sometimes you play in a tournament sometimes you play 4 games, it is so much fun. Another place to go is 805 volleyball you do not play games but they teach you a lot and it is for 1:30:00 that is 30 more minutes than U.S.Y.V.L has. Or you can do it at your house all you need is 2 poles 2 tires and fill each one up with cement and than get a rope and make it a little similar to the real net, and there you have a perfect volleyball net.\n\nWhy it is fun\nSome people think volleyball is not fun, but have not seen the fun side of it. After some practices you get popsicles after, if it is hot. And you sometimes get to be outside on the beach falling on the sand or indoors having fun with your friends. I love to play beach volleyball and indoor volleyball because I always know that at least one person in the crowd is always cheering me on.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all you should play volleyball it is a good exercise for your body and such a fun sport! I bet you one day you would be a great volleyball player!", "doctitle": "01_Medina-Kim_09", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 26.5, "average": 2.21, "criteria": {"overall": 2.5, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 2.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.0, "craft": 2.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "Good sequencing transitions.", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 61, "end_index": 65, "old_text": "Hey", "new_text": "Hey,", "type": "punctuation", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 306, "end_index": 328, "old_text": "How to play volleyball", "new_text": null, "type": "grammar", "comment": "you need a complete sentence"}, {"start_index": 579, "end_index": 599, "old_text": "where you where you", "new_text": "where you", "type": "grammar", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 622, "end_index": 681, "old_text": "your two hands using your pointer finger and your thumb and", "new_text": "your two hands, using your pointer finger and your thumb, and", "type": "punctuation", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 724, "end_index": 747, "old_text": "there is serving where", "new_text": "there is serving, where", "type": "punctuation", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 890, "end_index": 901, "old_text": "passing you", "new_text": "passing, you", "type": "punctuation", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 921, "end_index": 926, "old_text": "held", "new_text": "hold", "type": "spelling", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 1003, "end_index": 1017, "old_text": "thumbs in.

World War 1 ended and people in america are buying the stock market like crazy! Oh what\u2019s that, they sold oh no! With America\u2019s economy crashed, the government is forced to stop all foreign trade, making the effect global. With the UK being one of the victims, Australia fell like all the other countries. Why, it\u2019s because Australia attached the gold standard to the UK. Meanwhile, soldiers returned to their country after World War 1 and the government gave them land in west Australia. As a result, they turned into farmers, because of this the government promise to give farmers more subsides or basically, lower the cost of taxes and other government-money-making-schemes. Soldier, we\u2019re going to talk about how it started, battle one and two, and the aftermath of this dumb war.\n\nHow it started: Emus!\nMeanwhile, Australia\u2019s economy has crashed and everyone is unemployed, poor, and in poverty. Now emus come. During their breeding season they flock to the coastlines of west Australia. Oh no! With added water supplies for livestock and free food, they thought it was a good idea to make farms their habitats. They broke through fences, and damaged crops. Another bad thing is that with the fences destroyed, rabbits could come in and destroy the rest of the crops. The farmers sent a team of ex-soldiers to the minister of defence, not the minister of agriculture. The team knew from WWI, machine guns were effective, so they ordered them to kill emus. George agreed to this, but with strict conditions: 1. The guns were to be used by personnels from the military. 2. The troop\u2019s transport will be financed by the Western Australian Government. 3. The farmers have to give the soldiers food, water, and housing. George also thought of this of a way to train troops of target practice. They also wanted to get some footage for this propaganda. With this negotiation, the troops are ready to go.\n\nAttempt one: This is unnecessary\nThe one who lead the army was Major G.P.W. Meredith Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal Australian Army. Two soldiers have been enlisted with two Lewis guns, with 10,000 lbs of ammunition. One newspaper account told that they were going to get 100 emu skins for making hats for light horsemen. Although, they were going to start on October 1932, heavy rainfall blocked their way. You see soldier, that rain makes emus scatter. As a result, they delayed the killing until early November. On November 2, around Campion they found at least 50 emus. With the help of the locals. They tried to round up the emus in an ambush. After two machine gun rounds, they killed a \u201cnumber\u201d of emus. Later that day, they killed \u201cperhaps a dozen\u201d emus. On November 4, they made an ambush and spotted 1000 emus. They killed 12 however, before the guns jammed and the emus ran away. The Meredith moved further where rumors said that the emus here were more domestic, considering the fact that this is Australia. Two more days later, and they noticed that the emu packs have a leader 6 ft tall, and they look for any the attackers and call it out to the rest of the pack. One time, the army got so desperate, they put a gun on top of a truck. Just so you know, it didn\u2019t work out so well. Two more days later, the army used up 25000 rounds of ammunition. The number of emus killed is uncertain. Some say 200 or 500 or even 50. Media didn\u2019t like that only a few emus were culled or killed. After some discussion, they withdrew from the war. Don\u2019t worry soldier, another battle will pop around.\n\nAttempt two: Still unnecessary\nOnce again, the farmers are having emu problems again. They called on the military and James Mitchell responded. They were looking at west Australia for the people they need for the operation. Sadly, Meredith is placed on the field again because of the minimum experienced machine gunners in Australia. On November 13 and 14, they successfully killed 40 emus. They next day however, was more difficult. By December 2nd, 100 emus were kicking the dust every week. On December 10, Meredith retold that he killed 986 emus with 9860 rounds used. Additionally, 2500 more emus died because of the bullet wounds.\n\nAftermath: Did that do anything?\nNo, apparently the emus kept destroying crops and farmers called for help again on 1934, 1943, and 1948. Fortunately for the emus, the government turned them down. Although, there was a new bounty system installed and 57034 emus have been killed for the bounty in 1934 of a 6 month-period. By December 1932, the UK had heard of this \u201cwar\u201d and some protested, saying that this \u201cextermination of the rare emu\u201d. \u201cHey we finally made better fences and the emus can\u2019t get in.\u201d said the farmers. Yes, sadly if farmers built better fences, then this war wouldn\u2019t exist. Now that you learned that this war is really unnecessary with how it started, these attempts, and the aftermath, you should know more about Australia\u2019s history.

Grey wolves eat a lot of different animals, mostly do everything together in a pack, and even in some places, they are almost extinct!\n\nCarnivores\n\n\tFirst of all, wolves are carnivores. They eat a variety of different animals like deer and moose. According to the article \u201cThese social animals cooperate on their preferred prey--large animals such as deer, elk, and moose. When they are successful, wolves do not eat in C. Wolves also eat smaller mammals, birds, fish, lizards, snakes, and fruit.\u201d\n\nLife in a Pack\n\n\tAlso, grey wolves do almost everything in a pack. For example, they eat, sleep, and hunt together. A pack usually has 6 to 10 wolves. There is always a female, male, and offspring. With their group, wolves are known to roam far distances like 12 miles in one day! The article says \u201cThe wolves communication skills are very important to the pack\u2019s survival. Wolves work together to hunt, raise their young, and protect their territory\u201d\n\nEndangered Grey Wolves\n\n\tLastly, grey wolves are all most extinct in some places like England. According to the article \u201cThough they almost never attack humans, wolves are considered one of the animal world\u2019s most fearsome natural villains. They do attack domestic animals, and countless wolves have been shot, trapped, and poisoned because of this tendency.\u201d\n\tIn the lower 48 states grey wolves were almost hunted to extinction! In a few places, grey wolves are considered endangered but in most places, they have good population numbers.\n\nConclusion\n\n\tIn conclusion, grey wolves eat a variety of animals, do everything in a pack, and are endangered.

What are the positions? Who are some great players or teams? What is the gear that they use in softball? Well, I will be teaching you all of those things! In this writing, I will be filling up your brain with knowledge on softball, for example, you will be earning about Jennie Finch, the best pitcher in the world. Are you excited? Well, I sure hope so, because to the next page we go!\n\nPlayers/teams\n\nHave you ever heard about Jennie Finch? Well, she is the best pitcher in the world! She played for many teams, an I am sure all of those pitchers out there, including me, want to be just like her. \u201cFinch had a 2-0 win-loss record in the 2004 Games, striking out 13 batters in eight innings while giving up only one hit, one walk and no run.\u201d States www.teamusa.org What that means is that she pitched 3 strikes each to 13 batters, and they either didn\u2019t swing at them or swung and missed. She gave four balls to one batter and she got to go to first base. One person hit the ball. But no one touched home plate! This was all in 1 game by the way! She is so impressive! Now, the next person i wanted to talk about was Noa Yakir. She is a third baseman just like me, and we are great friends! She is on our local college\u2019s team, the Cal Poly Mustangs. She is a great role model for me! Next, I wanted to talk about the Cal Poly Mustangs. They are a great team, and I have been to many of their games. One time, I was at their game, and Noa Yakir got the first play! They have a great player at each position and they always make good plays. I have noticed that over the years, there catches and throws are getting better. I highly recommend going to their games!\n\nPositions\n\nAs you get older you learn even more positions! There are many fun positions, but I will just be talking about 1st 2nd and 3rd. At first base, there is a lot of action. This is because when the batter hits the ball, the first place they will be running to is 1st. This means that your teammates will be throwing the ball to you. At second base you have to be at your base a lot. This means that you will be doing a lot of running. And last, at third, you have the most important job, you have to try to get them out at third, so they will have no chance of getting to home. Third is a very important position, and I play it! One time, the ball was thrown to me, and instead of moving my feet, I kept my foot on the base and tried to reach for it, and I mised, and she scored a point. Lesson learned, and that lesson would be to step off of the base if you need to. \u201cTrain insane or stay the same.\u201d states www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com. I guess I need more training! This is very true, and with the proper training, dedication, and love for softball, you can be a professional too someday.\n\nGear\n\nHave you ever wondered what the gear we use in softball is called? Well, for fielders, we have to wear a glove and a facemask. A glove is the thing that you catch the ball with. A face mask is the gear that is on our face. It helps us so that the ball does not hit our face when thrown. Now, if you are batting, you need a helmet and a bat, and maybe some batting gloves. A helmet is a piece of gear that protects your head. A bat is the thing that hits the ball, it\u2019s like a giant stick! The last thing I want to talk about is the catcher\u2019s gear. They have protective gear ALL over so the pitcher doesn\u2019t hit them. Look at the picture below to see all the gear that catchers wear!\n\nConclusion\n\nNow have you learned a lot about softball? Do you want to lay? Well, if you do, you will have to remember my three subtopics, players and teams, positions, and gear! Have fun playing and remember all those people who practiced hard, and played as hard as they could. Maybe you will be a softball legend someday!", "doctitle": "03_OConnell_5", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 33.0, "average": 2.75, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 3.0, "craft": 3.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 3.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 288, "end_index": 299, "old_text": "softball, f", "new_text": "softball.

Well I have the thing for you, a fingerboard (a miniature skateboard for your fingers.)\n\nFirst, when you want to get a fingerboard the prices vary a lot between the quality of it, rarenes, and were you find it.  When you start to buy fingerboard you should buy a Tech Deck because they have a low price at three dollars.  You can find these at Target, Walmart, and many more places.  When you start to get better at fingerboard you should go with p-rep fingerboards.  This is your next step because decks are made out of wood, they have bearings in the wheels, metlel trucks, and foam grip.  You can find this on their website at broken knuckle fingerboards.com.  Lastly, if you want to get the top of the line you should get a Milo art fb complete, flat face complete, berlinwood complete, and many more.  You should get one of these because they come in different widths in the deck size, they have metal trucks, bushings to make the trucks turn, foam grip, polie yerathang wheels with bearings, and a wood deck.  This price range is from fifteen dollars to one hundred fifty dollars.  You can get theses from milo niggle or flatface fingerboards.com.\n\nWhen you want to choose your fingerboard you need to look for things you like in a fingerboard.  Like if you like high kicks get high kicks- (kicks are the dips in the board that make you get up in the air.)  If you like low kicks get low kicks.  One way to choose a fingerboard is to see it in person.  This helps because what if they are trying to scam you.  Another way to choose a fingerboard is to look at pictures of it online.  This helps to so you can see reviews on it.  Lastly, just ask someone what they thought of the fingerboard.\n\nFirst, you want to get comfortable rolling on one to see your capabilities.  If your comfortable do that try the pop shovet.  How you do this maneuver is put your back finger on the back of the board, then put your front finger right under the front bolts, lastly shove it around 180 degrees and put your fingers on it.

That is what I am here to teach you. One of the reasons are they help are air. Also, they sometime shelter animals, or they can provide use with shade. So keep reading if you want to know more about why we should not cut down trees.\n\nAnimals\n\n\tDid you know that animals need tree so bad that some animals would probably die without trees?. They are so important to all of the animals. Inf act we need many trees on earth so animals can thrive and live comfortably. If there were no animals on earth, humans wouldn\u2019t be able to live on earth either. So, as you can see trees are so very important because without them no life forms would be able to live on earth!\n\nAir\n\n\tOk so you are probably thinking why do you have air for subject. Well trees help our air so much. Life could not exist on Earth without trees because they produce most of the oxygen that humans and wildlife breathe. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen using the process of photosynthesis. This is why we need trees on earth. Trees Improve Our Air Quality. Urban forests help to improve our air quality. Heat from the earth is trapped in the atmosphere due to high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other heat-trapping gases that prohibit it from releasing the heat into space. This creates a phenomenon known today as the \u201cgreenhouse effect.\n\nShade\n\n\tImagine a hot day, so hot that you get a sunburn. Then you go and sit under a tree that feels nice right?. Also it is cooling you down and it feels so good to be under the tree. Then you start thinking, we should stop cutting down trees. Trees are so valuable.\n\nConclusion\n\tSo now you have learned about air, animal, and shade. Since you have learned why we should not cut down trees. Maybe you can help keep trees alive all you had to do is find a way to help trees.\nThese are some ways to save trees\nPlay and create with trash.\nBorrow, share and donate books\nPlant a tree\nVisit the forest\nStay on the trails\nGet your Smokey on.\nUse paper wisely.

Because of how far away black holes are? Because of quasars, and because of what black holes really are! Well if you would like to I can answer all three of those questions right now.\n\n\tBlack holes are crazy because of how far away from earth they are. Later though when the sun explodes there will be a black hole pretty close because when stars explode they will form a black hole. Additionally right now the closest black hole is 3,000 light years away which is about 12-13 quadrillion miles. Finally black holes are so far it would take 10 million years to get to one in a car, 1 million for an airplane, and 20,000 years for a rocket.\n\n\tA black hole is also super crazy because of what happens to the energy. The energy that the black hole sucks up is put around it which over time when there is enough energy there is something called a quasar. Additionally quasars are all the energy around the massive black hole which will have enlarged over time. Finally quasars are only in the center of a galaxy because there is only so much energy outside of a galaxy which there are only 2-3 types of galaxies that have quasars in them. They are called spiral galaxies (the milky way) and ring galaxies.\n\n\tAlthough black holes are crazy because they are super far away because of what quasars are but black holes are crazy especially because of what they really could be. First black holes could be something that sucks things up and destroys them. The thing is that if it destroys something like an asteroid that has no energy, where does everything go??? Additionally black holes could also be wormholes/time warps that takes things to another dimension, time, and completely different area in space or on a planet. Finally black holes are most likely something that destroys things because according to the book black holes and other bizarre space objects by Jefferis Davis quasars are all the energy around the black hole which is still there and didn\u2019t disappear with a time wharp.\n\n\tIn conclusion black holes are crazy because they are so far away from are planet, because of what happens with the energy, and most of all because of what they could actually be. I personally think black holes are mostly likely going to be something that sucks things up and destroys stars and asteroids.

I mean cats are good landers\u2026 but not all the time\u2026 sometimes when they fall off of really high buildings, they sometimes die because their feet are broken or because of something else. And no one likes dying animals or pets or whatever.\n\n\tIn conclusion, cats are great at landing but sometimes NOPE. But most of the time cats are GREAT landers and they SOMETIMES make it ALL the time. Cats can be also great climbers like I said they have strong feet, and they can climb walls!", "doctitle": "03_Bradley_01", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average":

"plaintext": "Endangered Chinchillas\n\nOver 200 chinchillas are killed to make a single fur coat. Chinchillas are small South American rodents with soft gray fur and a long bushy tail. They do a little something for the environment, but are being killed by humans every day, and they have many natural threats as well, however you can help protect these adorable animals from extinction.\n\nWhat Chinchillas do for the Environment\n\n\tChinchillas don't do much for the planet but what they do do makes a difference. Sometimes they live in high altitudes and in high altitudes they have very thick fur to keep them warm in the winter. Seeds get stuck in their fur and they distribute the seeds to all the places that they go because the seeds fall off of them, then plants from different places will grow all over where they go. \n\nChinchillas Are Threatened by Humans\n\n\tOne reason chinchillas are being killed by humans is because chinchilla fur is considered the softest fur in the world. Chinchilla coats are also very beautiful. They are striped and almost metallic. Finally chinchilla coats can cost $1,000 - $5,000 dollars.\n\nChinchillas and Their Natural Predators\n\n\tIn addition to people killing them, chinchillas have many natural predators as well. Some of these predators include; skunks, felines, canines, and snakes, as well as and most birds of prey. One of the reasons why chinchillas have so many predators is because they are small and easy to catch. Chinchillas have an amazing technique that helps them not get eaten or killed. They do this by dis-attaching part of their fur so that they can try to make a quick escape. The fur that they lose will grow back eventually. \n\nHow We Can Save the Chinchillas\n\n\tThere are many ways and websites to help save the wild chinchillas. For example, volunteermatch.org is a great website to help. Another website that is very helpful to the furry creatures is save the wild chinchillas.org. Finally, you can go to your local pet store like petco and buy a chinchilla. The prices range from $150-$350 dollars. Even though they are pretty expensive just know that you are saving the little cuddly animals life.\n\n\tChinchillas help the environment but humans are killing them. They are also being killed by their natural predators in the wild but there are many different ways we can help save these furry little creatures.", "doctitle": "04_Maramba_4", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 34.5, "average": 2.88, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 4.0, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 2.5, "organization": 4.0, "elaboration": 3.0, "craft": 3.0, "spelling": 4.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "adding twin sentences as support would help", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 296, "end_index": 312, "old_text": "as well, however", "new_text": "as well.

Well if you do, then you will learn all of that and much, much, more if you read on! So read on.\n\nWhat they eat\n\tFirst you should know about what they eat. Wolves normally eat hooved animals. some are deer, moose, buffalo, goats, elk, and reindeer. But if despret eat hares, fish, beavers, bobcats, birds, and small rodents. Small rodents such as mise, or hamsters. Hares are male, wild rabbits or bunnies.\n\nWhere they live\n\tSecond you need to know where they live (in case you want to visit one after you finish this book). Wolves live in caves, in Europe, Alaska, Canada, and Asia, near water and food. Sometimes wolves move to other areas to follow the food, if the food travels.\n\nHow they live\n\tLast you probably should know how they live. Wolves live and hunt in packs, a pack is a family of wolves. So the babies stay in the cave if they are hungry, while the mothers or fathers kill the food and bring it back to the cave, where the babies are waitting. The babies also, are blind when they are born so they are usually really playful. Reasult, the fathers get covered with little playful pups.\n\nConculsion\n\tDo you know a little bit more about wolves than you did before you first read this?

Australian Shepherds tend to love this type of food because of the wetness, but if you are the person who wants to clean up their dog bowl because it smells bad or you just want to clean it in general, it won\u2019t be super hard but it will turn into a mess in your sink or trash can. If you get dry dog food, these dogs will eat this food for sure if their hungry. It\u2019s best to get grain-free dry dog food for them and its alot healthier. The dry dog food puppys like a lot too plus its not as big as a mess. These foods are both very good and healthy for the dogs, but dog treats are also great for them! There are many different kinds of dog treats, some even very unhealthy for certain breeds. Next time you go to the store to get dog food for your Australian Shepherd, I recommend to look what\u2019s in the food. If there are no ingredients on the container/bag, you probably shouldn\u2019t get it. Or if there are a bunch of ingredients that sound unhealthy to dogs, don\u2019t get it\n\tMake sure your Shepherd can munch on something good for them next time you buy them there food.\n\nOuter Beauty\n\n\tGorgeous Aussies on the inside, but also on the outside. How do they look though? Well, many Aussies (Aussie means Australian Shepherd) look very similar, but there are things that look different about them like their height, eyes, and possibly even coat colors. Male Australian Shepherds are commonly 20 to 23 inches tall to the shoulder, while female Aussies are often 18 to 22 inches tall to the shoulder. These dogs aren\u2019t the biggest, but also not the smallest. Many people just say that their medium sized dogs, not exact height.\n\tAussies also have perdant ears (ears that go up) and a bobtail. A lot of dogs get their normal tails cut off the get bobtails, but not this dog! Their bobtails and perdant ears match very perfectly with their coat colors. The well known coat colors of the Aussies are black, gray, white, and tan. But, those colors are only for the Blue Aussie, there are different coat colors and also for their eyes. These different types of Australian Shepherds still do look very similar so people will know, but they just have color differences. Black Aussies normally have brown eyes and Red Aussies have either amber eyes or blue and amber eyes. But of course, there are many more types of Aussies with many different eye colors a coat colors. Are you the one who will research about the types of Aussies and what their beauty is?\n\nWhy is it Named That?\n\n\tA very common question, that many ask, that many wonder and think of everyday. Why is it named that? Well, there are many theories that people think, and nobody actually knows the real answer to that question but a theory that hundreds and maybe thousands of peoplehave is this.\n\tAustralian Shepherds are named Australian because they have a blue merle pattern (blue eyes) similar to many dogs brought over from Australia to America; thus, because of the color pattern, they were simply called \u201cAustralian\u201d as so many other dogs were that had the blue merle.\n\tThis explains and hopefully answers the mysterious question of, \u201cWhy is it named that?\u201d.\n\nConclusion\n\n\tMeals, outer beauty, and even the reason to its name. What more could you ask for? You now might be an intermediate ata this breed of dogs and could maybe become advanced if you practice enough! Could you be the one, who will answer the unknown of these dogs? If you don\u2019t think so, I want you to try.\n\tMaybe, like I said at the beginning, are you inspired because of these dogs?", "doctitle": "03_OConnell_9", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 35.0, "average": 2.92, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.5, "transitions": 2.5, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 3.5, "craft": 3.5, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 3.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 732, "end_index": 737, "old_text": " food", "new_text": " foods", "type": "grammar", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 1181, "end_index": 1186, "old_text": "their", "new_text": "they're", "type": "word choice", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 1286, "end_index": 1293, "old_text": "puppys ", "new_text": "puppies ", "type": "spelling", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 1299, "end_index": 1308, "old_text": " lot too ", "new_text": " lot too, ", "type": "punctuation", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 1891, "end_index": 1896, "old_text": "there", "new_text": "their", "type": "word choice", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 1919, "end_index": 1935, "old_text": "Gorgeous Aussies", "new_text": "Aussies are not only gorgeous", "type": "grammar", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 2412, "end_index": 2417, "old_text": "their", "new_text": "they're", "type": "word choice", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 3175, "end_index": 3177, "old_text": "a ", "new_text": "and ", "type": "spelling", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 3370, "end_index": 3380, "old_text": " everyday.", "new_text": " every day", "type": "spelling", "comment": ""}, {"start_index": 3379, "end_index": 3381, "old_text": ".

Well the cause of all this is climate change. Climate change is earth's temperature rising which creates problems with the environment. For example, in 2040 the Arctic may have it's completely ice free summer. Which means that animals will die out. For instance, polar bears will come extinct with no ice. Climate change will make things become extinct, it has many bad effects, it is caused by us, and you can stop it.\n\nThings That Will Become Extinct With Climate Change\n\n\tDid you know that the Bramble Cay melomys have already become extinct because of climate change? The Kolah is one of the animals at risk of extinction. And if Koalas go extinct, it will destroy plants that are vital for other species. The ringed seal may also go extinct, and so may the leatherback and the Hawksbill sea turtle. And, if sea turtles go extinct, any animals that survive on healthy seagrass beds, or coral reefs will go extinct. The Arctic fox may also go extinct. If they go extinct, many animals will overpopulate. In 2050 there are many animals that will go extinct if we don't do something. They include, Orangutans, Lemurs, Rhinos, Polar bears, Gorillas, Vaquitas, and Cheetahs. Lemurs have been around for 7 million years! That makes them the longest living mammal on the entire planet! If you like honey, you'll definitely want to stop climate change if you know this. Another animal that will become extinct is, the Rusty Patched bumble Bee! The Rusty Patched bumble Bee population has decreased 87%! And, Bees have existed on planet earth for 40 million years! Also, it's not just animals that will become extinct, plants will become extinct as well. This will happen when animals become extinct, other animals will overpopulate. If these animals that overpopulate are herbivores, then plants will become extinct because of all of the animals eating them.\nIn summary, because of climate change, many things will become extinct.\n\nThe Bad Effects of Climate Change\n\n\tDid you know that if climate change keeps up, hurricanes will stronger, and more intense. Also, the sea level will rise one to four feet by 2100. Also, if you in Jakarta Indonesia, Bangkok Thailand, Lagos Nigeria, Manila Philippines, Dhaka Bangladesh Shanghai, China, London England, or Houston Texas your town will be engulfed by the ocean in about 2100. Additionally, the arctic will become ice free. To add on, climate change also affects our food. Since climate change is earth's temperature rising, it will make it rain less, which means that plants will be missing out on water, and they won't be able to grow. To add on, climate change could also affect our health. For example, the air quality will be worse. Also, lots of animals and plants have to migrate to different, cooler areas of the world. \"Some species -- including mosquitoes, ticks, jellyfish, and crop pests -- are thriving. Booming populations of bark beetles that feed on spruce and pine trees, for example, have devastated milllions of forested areas in the U.S.\" Said National Geographic, Effects of Climate Change. As well as, many diseases will spread. For example, malaria.\nIn summary, climate change has many bad effects.\n\nHow Does Climate Change Happen\n\n\t\"Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping,\" Said The Causes of Climate Change. If this happens, the earth will automatically warm up if the heat cannot escape. It will just be trapped not being able to get out. This is called the greenhouse effect. Some of the greenhouse gasses are, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Water Vapor, and Nitrous Oxide. \"Humans are burning fossil fuels, releasing huge amounts of carbon pollution and trapping more and more heat in the atmosphere.\" Said How Do we Know Humans are Causing Climate Change. Planet earth's temperature depends on how much energy leaving the planet. \"When incoming energy from the sun is absorbed by the Earth system, Earth warms.\" Said Causes of Climate Change.\nIn summary,\nClimate change happens in different ways.\n\nHow To Stop Climate Change\n\n\tDid you know that you could help stop climate change just by riding a bike, taking public transportation, or carpooling? You could also help stop climate change by using renewable energy. If you can do anything to stop climate change, you should do it. For if you don't, many, many things will go wrong. Also, to help stop climate change you could buy an energy efficient car, or get a green career. For example, you could help make solar panels. \"Any electronic gadget you can turn on with a remote (TV, DVD player, Nintendo, Xbox) uses power even when it is \"off.\" Appliances with a digital clock (like a coffee maker) or a power adapter (like a laptop computer) also suck power like a sneaky vampire.\" Said Climate Kids.\nIn summary,\nYou should help stop climate change.\n\n\tDid you know that in 1950, \"CO2 levels broke records from the previous 400,000 years, sharply rising and continuing to grow?\"\nIn summary,\nClimate change will make things become extinct, it has many bad effects, it is caused by us, and you can stop it.", "doctitle": "04_Maramba_3", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead":

And my book is about space. I will teach you about the wonders of the stars that hang above us. And what\u2019s deep inside the planet. And how much power the sun has to melt anything. Read my book and you will learn all about space.\n\nThe stars\nIn this chapter there will be stars. Not ordinary stars. Some stars are planets. did you know that when the moon has half of its side the other half is black, but the moon is not forming its just when the sun goes to the other half of the world the moon will be full. If you could walk all the way around the world, you would be able to notice that is is getting brighter and back to dark. And when the moon reflects with the sun it makes a spectrum. Spectrum: A band of colors seen in a rainbow\n\nAnd the reason why the stars are so bright is because in the solar system the sun is in front of all the planets the sun is there and it makes all the planets bright. The moon is the most driest planet. The sun is also the most hottest and brightest star ever. If you are wondering if the sun is in front of all the planets why are they melting because the sun can melt everything, well almost everything. The only thing the sun can\u2019t melt is the planets it\u2019s how far they are from the sun adn how many layers these planets have. And yes that\u2019s how strong planets are. Ok so earth and other three inner planets of our solar system ( Mercury, Venus and Mars ) are made of rock containing common minerals feldspars and metals like magnesium and aluminum. So is pluto. the other plants are not solid, Jupiter, for instance, is mostly made up of trapped helium, hidrogen, and water.\n\nPlanet Earth\nIn this chapter I will teach you what lies in the earth and what the earth\u2019s heart is made of. So there is 4 layers of crust, 1st is the crust we live on. 2nd is called Lithosphere, the 3rd crust is called Asthenosphere, and the last crust is way hotter than hot metal, than magma, and than hotter than lava. The last and final crust deep inside that earth\u2019s heart is called the iiiiiiiii inter core\n\nConclusion\nThank you for going with me on this amazing adventure riding through the stars. digging up the Crust of the world, and learning all about the planets of the whole solar system, thank you for reading my SPACE book, I you enjoyed it, thank you.", "doctitle": "03_Bradley_04", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 20.0, "average": 1.67, "criteria": {"overall": 1.5, "lead": 2.5, "transitions": 1.0, "ending": 2.0, "organization": 2.0, "elaboration": 1.5, "craft": 1.5, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 7, "end_index": 70, "old_text": "Hello there, my name is Bellaraine.

And the rules and the game also penalties. And how you get free kicks in a soccer game.\n\nChapter 1\nThe game\n\nHave you ever wondered how a soccer game works. i will tell you for an example. in a game there are types of games like a final a final is the same thing like a regular game but you get a trophy if you win a final. In a match you play with 11 players and try to win a game.\n\nChapter 2\nThe rules\n\nDo you know the rules of the game. if you don\u2019t know i could teach you. The first rule is to have 11 players on the field. And to not handball if you don\u2019t no it\u2019s when you touch the ball in the box but when it\u2019s a throw in you can touch it. And goalkeeper is the only won that touches it with in the box. And you can\u2019t make fecal contact with players. Or you can get a red or a yellow card that means you sit out for three matches. Fact Cristiano ronaldo had to sit out three matches in juventus and it was his 2 match in juventus.\n\nChapter 3\nPenalties\n\nA way to get a penalty is if you for an example is. When you hand a ball in the keepers box that means. Your opponent gets a shot on target to score. And another way to give your opponent a penalty is by slide tackling in the goal box that means a red or a yellow.\n\nChapter 4\nFree kicks\n\nA way to get a free kick is. if your enemy tries to tackle you outside of the goal box that\u2019s a free kick for your team. And if you slide some won you get your enemy a free kick. And free kicks are really dangerous when you are losing a game.\n\nThat\u2019s why i think people should like soccer because it is fun.

"plaintext": "Introduction\nDid you know that Simon Cowell is a producer of America\u2019s got Talent? Simon Cowell is a very important person to the performance history he has done many things to make performing shows on TV better. Today I am going to teach you about Simon\u2019s family, Simon\u2019s jobs, and Simon\u2019s fame.\n\nSimon\u2019s Family\nIn Simon Cowell\u2019s life he had a big family. Simon Phillip Cowell was born on October 7, 1959. Right now, Simon is 59 years old. Simon was born in London UK. Simon\u2019s mom\u2019s name is Juliet and his dad\u2019s name is Eric. Also, Simon has two sisters, June and Lindsay. Not only that but Simon has a lot of brothers. Some of his brothers include Michel, John, and Nicholas. Simon also has a half brother named Tony. Simon\u2019s wife is named Lauren Silverman and his son is named Eric. Nowadays Simon doesn\u2019t really get together with his brothers and sisters but every once in a while he does. As you can see Simon has a big family, if you think about it you actually might want to be in a family as big as his, maybe.\n\nSimons Jobs\nSimon has had many jobs over the years. The main job Simon has now is a judge and producer on AGT (America\u2019s got Talent.) Not only is Simon a judge and a producer on AGT but he was an actor, music producer, film producer, and much, much more. Simon was bored of being a music producer so he started all the got talents to hear more than just music, but a variety of acts. Simon didn\u2019t start AGT as the first got talent because by then he didn\u2019t live in America, he lived in England. The first got talent was BGT (Britain\u2019s got Talent) where Simon lived. Simon started BGT in 2007.\n\nSimon\u2019s Fame\nWould you like to live a normal life, or a life like Simon Cowell\u2019s? If you lived a life like Simon Cowell you would be on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. You would get $950,000 dollars a year. Oh wait! Did I say $950,000, sorry, I meant $95,000,000. Simon Cowell has around $550,000,000 right now. If you had money like that you could buy almost anything you wanted. You could buy a huge house like Simon\u2019s. You could buy a swimming pool like Simon. You could buy so many things if you had money like Simon. Another thing is, Simon gets paid $25,000 everytime he gets a paycheck on AGT.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all Simon Cowell is a very important part of history in many ways. Now that you know about Simon\u2019s family, jobs, and fame you should do more research on his life style a stuff like that. If you\u2019re wondering like me if Juliet is Simon\u2019s mom or stepmom you should find out yourself. If you lived a life like Simon Cowell, you will live a long happy life, or as Simon would say on AGt \u201cI don\u2019t like it, I love it!\u201d", "doctitle": "04_Andre_3", "grades": [{"version": 1,

When we got miko I have him his food and water, I played with him when my mom coudin\u2019t, and I took him to go to the bathroom, I think that\u2019s responsibel enough to have my own pet. \n\nI think I am mutre enough and my parent\u2019s wount have to buy the stuff for the pet also I am very responsibel to have my own pet.", "doctitle": "07_Rice_8", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 26.0, "average": 2.17, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 2.0, "ending": 2.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.5, "craft": 2.0, "spelling": 2.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}]}, {"id": 203, "plaintext": "Mythical Beasts\nDo you know what really makes thunder? Mythical beasts are unpredictable. One reason that mythical beasts are unpredictable is they all have amazing stories, cool powers, and they look crazy.\nOne reason mythical beasts are unpredictable is that they have awesome stories. First i\u2019ll tell you about the thunderbird. In a dark forest lives a Native American tribe that was running low on food so they prayed to the gods to give them food but there was a thunderstorm and the tribe was heart broken then a huge bird with a whale in his talons swooped down in sight of the tribe and gave them a whale. Another story is the story of the Leviathan. The Leviathan was a sea creature that could breathe fire and swallow boats whole and so indestructible that Poseidon himself had to slay it. Finally stories can be funny scary or even sad but they are always awesome!\nAnother good reason mythical creatures are unpredictable is that they have cool powers. First the roc is very good at hurling builders because of the encounter with Jason and the argonauts. Jason tried to steal their egg and they started chucking rocks at him. Next Charybdis is very good at sucking people into whirlpools because she is a evil water nymph that was punished for flooding towns and Zeus turned her into a hideous sea monster. Finally almost all mythical animals have at least one superhuman power like being immune to fire or being able to shoot lightning out of your eyes but they are all super cool.\nAlthough mythical beasts are unpredictable because they have awesome stories, they have cool powers, but most of all they look crazy! First the northern hydra has nine heads like a snake and a dogs body and a dragon tail the middle one can breathe fire and if you cut off a head two more grow back. Next a Cyclops has rags for clothes teeth for a necklace and has one eye in the middle of his head and is immune to fire. Finally all mythical creatures have crazy appearances.\nIn conclusion mythical creatures are unpredictable because they have awesome stories, cool powers, and most of all, because they look crazy.

But anyways, my name is Matt and I will be teaching you about gaming! You probably have played a game like Minecraft, or Roblox but that\u2019s not all i\u2019m talking about. Im talking about, tips and tools, Devices, Games, and that\u2019s not it! But let\u2019s get into the writing!\n\nTips and Tools\nHave you ever thought of playing games that are not boring, and not stupid? Like life, the game? Have you ever wanted to type on games and click with a mouse, and sit on a chair that costs $399? Okay, then read this! If you want to play on high FPS (Frames per second) you want to get a pc or PS4. A game with pretty good graphics is Fornite! You have probably heard of it, and you have probably played it. It\u2019s a fun game, where you can battle other players, play with your friends, and watch LIVE EVENTS! That\u2019s awesome. You may call it, \u201cStupid\u201d, Or, \u201cThe worst game in the world\u201d But you should try playing it! You want to sit down,right? Well you can get a chair that is very comfortable. It\u2019s a gaming chair! Even PewDiePie has a gaming chair! But you can buy another chair, that is not as comfortable as a gaming chair. A tip for Nintendo Switch players, is the pro controller. Don\u2019t use those stupid joy cons! They will not help you with games, at all. But the pro controller will help you a lot. A tool for PC, is a good PC! You should probably get a good monitor, not like the ones at your school. Those are the tips and tools! Hope you learned something from reading this!\n\nDevices\nHave you ever wanted to play a video game, for example, Roblox, or Minecraft? Well you need a device, or a friend that has a device. But I prefer a console or PC, not a mobile device. For example, Phone, Tablet, Kindle, or amazon tablet. PS4 runs really good. If you want a good device, I prefer a PS4 or a PC. PC and PS4 have a really good FPS, and Mobile is not so good. Personally I do not like the XBOX, but it is good. The FPS is good too, but so is every other console, and PC. So, yes. You know what is good, and what isn\u2019t good. And Nintendo is like, between Xbox and phone.\n\nGames!\nNow you have a console, and you have some tips. You want to play a game right? Well, let me recommend some for you. If you got a PC, then you will want good games, and some other games. I think you should get Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s. It\u2019s also on mobile, but you want the better experience, right?! Yes. Also there is Fortnite and Wizard101. Fortnite is a PVP, Battle royale, and RPG game. But you have to buy the RPG version, which is only on PS4, Xbox, and PC. The battle royale, PVP mode is on all devices. Wizard101 is a PC game, where you have to battle different beasts, and other Wisards! You level up, and collect different cards, and clothes. You start with a wizard robe, shoes, and a hat. There is also Roblox, Minecraft, and other awesome games.\n\nConclusion\nNow you know tons of stuff about gaming. You know some tips and tools, you know devices, and games! I hope you get the victory royale! And you can play ROBLOX on the go with your mobile device! Along with the blocky game where you kill animals, and call PETA! Or feed the food to your wolf that dies in lava when you try to mine diamonds. I t\u2019s Minecraft. And you can kill wizards and beasts in battles! So get out there and eat bread, and drink G-Fuel!", "doctitle": "06_Ankola_2", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 29.0, "average": 2.42, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 3.0, "transitions": 2.0, "ending": 3.0, "organization": 3.0, "elaboration": 2.5, "craft": 3.0, "spelling": 3.0, "punctuation": 1.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "Good information, organized, and clear", "lead": "Used good \"voice\" to introduce his paper.

Well I do. Oh you don\u2019t know what it is surprise surprise. Then today I will be teaching about baseball. I will teach you about what is it. bases, and players/teams. So I hope you love my writing and learn a lot.\n\nFwoosh, \u201cStrike three you\u2019re out\u201d the catcher says with a despairing tone in his voice. Today I\u2019ll teach you about rules. One of the first most known rule is three strikes you\u2019re out. Another well known rule is if you hit the home plate after touching every other base you score a point. Another is you have to get the ball to the hot spot to get someone out if there not on a base. Or you can catch the ball right when they hit it no matter where they are.\n\nBases\n\nHave you ever watched or played baseball? Well if you have then you may know the bases. The main base the one you hit at is called the home base. When you hit the first base you run to is pretty much what it is first base. The second one you run to is considered second base. The third one is third base. Then it\u2019s back to the dugout.\n\nMost Known Teams\n\nTeams are one of the most important parts of baseball. Today I will teach you about the most known teams. Some of the most known teams include the Dodgers, Saints, yankees, and red sox. There are other teams like the cardinals too. There are also teams like the angeles, blue jays, rangers, astros, athletics, and rays wich aren\u2019t as popular but are still really popular.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo I hope you learned a lot about baseball. I talked about rules, bases, and teams. Baseball is fun I hope you try it and see you next time on my next book about civil war. So go out and play baseball.

Cats are unique because of many reasons. They are unique because, Their tails are unique, There are many types of breeds, and most of all, they tesst responsibility.\n\nOne reason Cats are unique is that Their tails are unique. For example, Their tails allow for balance. It can be used as a counterbalance to make it easy for making turns on a balance board. Another example, is that Their tails can also be for communication, With their tail, you can understand what your cat is feeling. Like if their tail is up, their ready to attack. Or if their tails is down they are calmed. Finally, cats can actually like without tails. Some cats are born without tails. And when they lose their tails, they can grow another one.\n\nAnother reason Cats are unique is that there are many types of breeds. For example, There are many types of mexican cats Like the Gato, which are one of the most calmed cats. To add on, There are even more egyptian cats than any other countrie that has cats. They have egyptian mau, and the Don hairless. Finally, their are also european cats, Like the famous European shorthair, and also the burmese.\n\nAlthough Cats are unique because their tails are unique and because their breeds, Cats are unique especially because they test responsibility. For example, if you want a cat, Make sure you keep the bathroom door closed! One time, I accidentally left the bathroom door open. So my cat went inside and ripped all the toilet paper into shreds. And let\u2019s just say my dad was not happy! Another reason why you have to be responsible is because cats sleep. A lot. One time my cat, (named Lola) slept in my room for 6 hours straight while I was at school. Cats can sleep a long time, so make sure your quiet!\n\nIn conclusion, Cats are unique because Their tails are unique, and there are many types of breeds, and most of all because they test responsibility. I think if you don\u2019t have a cat, you should try getting one from the shelter. Also, if you want a question, do you love cats as much as I do?", "doctitle": "10_Jellen_7", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall":

I will be teaching you all about it. First I will teach you about the equipment you need, then I will teach you about the rules of golf, and finally, I will teach you about the golf Competition.\n\nThere is a lot of equipment you need for golf, Obviously, some of the most important things you need is a golf ball, and golf clubs, but you would be surprised on how much clothes matter in golf. You need different clothes with technology for different days. For example it is super cold out, the clothes that you would where would have technology in them that would hold body heat in, but if it was warm, you would want clothes that let your skin breath so you wouldn\u2019t be as hot. Also, some of the other equipment you need is a golf bag, a glove (so your hands don\u2019t get blisters), and golf shoes. Something really good about golf shoes is, if the spikes on the bottom get worn out, you can just take the shoes to a golf shop and get new spikes on them! As you can see there is a lot of equipment you need for golf.\n\nYou know that in golf you need a lot of equipment, but there also a lot of rules in golf, such as handicaps, tee boxes, and penalty strokes. A handicap is how many strokes over par you are (\u201cpar\u201d is hitting the ball 72 times per 18 holes). For example, if your average score for a round was a 79 (6 over par), your handicap would be 6. However, if you played a person with a handicap of 0, they would have to give you 6 strokes for the match to be fair. Also, tee boxes, are places where you start hitting the ball on each hole. Different players start at different tee boxes, for example, my dad starts from farther tee boxes than me because he hits it farther. You would get a penalty stroke (an extra stroke) and tee off again. However, if you hit it in the water, you get a penalty stroke, but usually, there is a spot where you can drop the ball and play from there, that place is called a \u201cdrop zone\u201d.\n\nFinally, I will be teaching you about golf competition. For kids, there is a local tour called U.S. Kids Golf, but if you are a beginner, you shouldn\u2019t do that. U.S. Kids golf is all over the world even not in the U.S., which still doesn\u2019t make any sense to me, because it is literally called U.S. Kids Golf. Unfortunately, for grown ups, there is no local tour, it is either you travel the world to play professional golf tournaments, or, you just play golf courses close to you. Also, one of the most important kids golf tournaments is called, U.S. Kids Golf World Championships, it is where the best 100 or so kids in the entire world for their age, compete in North Carolina to be crowned the best kid at golf in the entire world, it lasts two days. I went there, the place was absolutely beautiful, but it was VERY rainy. Even though I didn\u2019t do that good, I still beat some people, and I qualified for it again this year! So now I am hoping I will do better this time.\n\nAll in all, I hope you learned a lot more about golf than you thought you would, but trust me, you have about a gazillion more things to know, even I do! You have learned about all sorts of the equipment you need to play, you have learned about the rules of golf, and finally, you have learned about some of the competitions in the golf world. I absolutely love golf, and I think it is important for people to know more about it, otherwize, they just think it is a sport where you hit a golf ball and try to make it in the hole.

For example according to google just a giraffes legs are taller than many humans-about 6 feet. Also, according to google when a baby giraffe is born it stands at 6 ft. tall and after 10 hours it will be running with the other Giraffes! And lastly on Google it says that a northern giraffe average height is 15-20 ft. tall.\n\nBig Heart\nAnother reason that Giraffes are amazing is that they have a big heart. One example is according to google and it says that a Giraffe has a big heart because of its long neck, because they spend a lot of time moving their heads down low top high so they need a way to keep the blood flowing to the brain so they don't get light headed. Also on Google I learned that \u201cscientists once thought that vessels in the giraffe's neck siphoned blood from the heart to the brain\u201d. And lastly Giraffes have a big heart because they are kind and gentle animals and don't bother attacking if they aren't threatened.\n\nDifferent\nAlthough Giraffes are amazing because they are the tallest land animals and because they have a big heart they are all different just like people.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion Giraffes are amazing because they are the tallest living land animals and they have a big heart and most of all because they are all different from each other just like people i hope that you think giraffes are amazing too.", "doctitle": "03_Bradley_07", "grades":

These players are some of the best in the NFL and that is really hard. I like them and after this I hope you do to.\n\nTom Brady\n\tDid you know that Tom Brady\u2019s is 6\u20194\u201d and 225 lb? Last year Tom had 4,355 yards passing, that is one of the most. Tom brady went to college at michigan you might think I'm crazy but he was not the best QB. QB stands for Quarterback. Tom brady is number 12 on the patriots. You might think Tom brady's name is just Tom Brady but you are wrong because his name is Thomas Edward Patrick Brady. Jr. Tom's longest pass ever was 99 yards. He has the most Super Bowl rings ever that number is 6.\n\nRob Gronkowski\n\tFun fact Rob Gronkowski had 7,861 yards in his career. Rob has 79 TD in his career that means that he got about 11 touchdowns in a season. TD means Touchdown. Rob Gronkowski won three super bowls. He was number 87 on the patriots. He played with Tom brady who has the most Super Bowl rings ever. He only fumbled ONE time last year and he only fumbled four times in his hole career then he had four seasons when he did not fumble at all.\n\nEzekiel Elliott\n\tDid you know that Ezekiel Elliott is number 21 on the cowboys. His longest catch and run last year was 38 yards. Ezekiel has two nicknames and they are [Zeke or Eze]. He has 28 TDs in his career, TD is touchdown. In his hole career he has 4048, so that means that in three years he has 4048 yards. Ezekiel is 6'0\" that is small for sports. He's only 228 LB that is average for sports. In his first year he was the best runningback in the hole league that does not happen very often in the NFL then the second year he did good to.\n\nConclusion\nOffensive players in the NFL. I think you should remember the names Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Ezekiel Elliott. You play catch with a friends it is fun. You should start to watch football because it is fun and you might like it. I think you should play football with a person. I like football.

to Heely. Heelys are shoes that have wheels on the bottom of them. There\u2019s three easy steps to Heely, first you have to have the correct gear then you have to be in the correct area. Lastly and most important you have to know how to do it.\n\nWhat to wear to Heely\n\tFirst you have to have the correct gear you want to have socks that cover your ankles not no show socks then they\u2019ll give you a blister and that will hurt then you will need elbow pads and knee pads so if you fall you won\u2019t get hurt. If your a beginner I recommend you wear pants so if you fall you still won\u2019t hurt yourself even if your wearing knee pads you could still hurt yourself.\nWhere to be to Heely\n\tSecond of all you need to be in the right area a great place for me is in the kitchen because the floor in smooth because it\u2019s wood when you Heely you don\u2019t want to be on tile because the tile has cracks and that\u2019s how you will fall smooth wood is a great place to Heely also don\u2019t Heely on gravel because gravel is bumpy and that\u2019s the easiest way to fall.\n\nHow to Heely\n\tThird of all you want to know how to do it it\u2019s the most important step so first to get the hang of it you want to put your weaker foot out on the heel and push off from something. For example I used a chair and pushed off to the couch and I did that over and over intel I got good at it another way to do it is have someone hold you hands well you push off and then practice that over and over again it really helps the more you do it the better you get at it.\n\nIn conclusion you have learned a little bit about the tree easy steps to do it the first step was what you need in order to Heely somethings were socks and knee pads then  the second step was you have to be in the right area and the third step was the most important step which was how to Heely.", "doctitle":

shouldn\u2019t litter \n\nTable of Contents \nIntro\nWhat littering does\nHow it effects on animals \nHow it effects on people \n\n\nLook you can get fined!!!\n\nIntroduction \n\u201cMmm mmm mmmhhh\u201d sorry that was just someone littering! This book is all about why you shouldn't litter. HEre are some of the reasons why you shouldn't litter one what littering does, how it effects on animals, and how it effects on people. Those are some good reasons why you shouldn't litter.follow these things and you won't be littering.\n\nWhat littering does\n\nLittering is a very bad thing to do. But some people decide to do it anyway because they don't know the consequences. One of the consequences is it just makes are world a trashy place to be living in. Also, it makes our world even more polluted than it already is. Did you know that if you litter you can get a fine? A fine is where the police will say that you owe them money and then that is really bad because then sometimes you will have to go pick up trash that isn't even yours, it is called community service. Then when your picking up the trash and you see someone driving by and throw some more trash on the ground and you have to pick it up then you will understand what other people have to go through and you won't do it again. \n\nHow it effects on animals\n\nDid you know when you throw trash out say your car window and your by the beach then it will somehow end up in the ocean. And a fishie will think that it is food and they will eat it. And you should know that it will kill them. Do you really want to kill a innocent fish and take its life away> Cause I don\u2019t. While we are talking about the ocean, same thing it will end up in the ocean and pollute the water. And you know that little kids will swim in the water and most likely they will sick just because of someone who through a piece of trash in the ocean. Also, when you throw it out on the beach then it ends up in the water and it could wrap around a fish\u2019s neck and kill an innocent fishie. \n\nHow it effects on people \n\nSay you\u2019re walking down the road and your eating a bag of sour watermelon gummies. And there is a little bit of it left but you are full so you just throw it on the sidewalk. Then a little kid walks by and sees the bag of gummies and secretly EATS ONE. Then they realise that they are allergic to the gummies. And there by them self and no one is there to help and they DIE. A little kid just died because of one person littered. Imagine if everyone littered and it never stopped see how many kids would die just because of people being lazy and not throwing their trash in a trash can. Also, it can pollute the air. And people with asthma will get really bad cough attacks and almost die because some one littered. \n\n\nConclusion \n\nNow you know What littering does, how it affects animals, and how it affects people. You know why you should not litter and how you should help the environment.Also, people that don\u2019t  litter   have to suffer because of people littering. I challenge you to go spread the words about Why you shouldn't litter. And then tell other people to spread the word too. Because I don't want my world or yours to be trashy. \n\n", "doctitle": "02_GADGIL_2", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null,

Well I got one for you\u2026 it\u2019s SOCCER!!! Soccer is an interactive sport. In the next few paragraphs I will be teaching you about soccer!!! If you are a beginner you will need basic skills and if you are an advanced player you will need advanced skills. You will also learn about the field and setup. Lastly you will learn about famous fouls and goals and records. Keep reading to be a soccer star!\n\nSkills\nSkills are very important in soccer. One skill is dribbling. To play soccer you have to know how to dribble. To dribble you run with the ball close by your feet so the defender can\u2019t get to the ball. Another skill you need to know how to do is shooting the ball in the goal. To shoot the ball you dribble the ball towards the goal you swipe your foot at the bottom of the ball with your shoelaces. Make sure you don\u2019t shoot at the goalie! The last beginner skill you need to know is passing. To pass, you run down the field dribbling if a defender is coming at you you can pass to a teammate. With the inside of your foot you kick to your teammate. Now that you know some beginner skills here are advanced skills. For example goalie. The goalie stands in front of the goal and does anything to stop the ball from going into the goal. The last advanced skill is headering. To header the ball you shit the ball with your foreheard if the ball is to high to kick. Now you know about beginner and advanced skills. \n\nField\nTo play soccer you need a field with a certain setup. On the field you have to have a goal. The field should have 2 goals, 2 goal areas, sidelines, a center circle and 2 penalty boxes. The field is usually 110-120 yards. The setup of players depends on your age. If you are 10 years old you will have 11 players on the field at once. The positions that you will play are defender these people defend the goal midfielder these people score and defend, forward these people score and get the ball close to the goal lastly the goalie, the goalie defends the goal they are backup incase the forwards on the other team get past the defenders on your team. \n\nFamou fouls goals and records\nFouls are not good, goals are amazing, some records have never been broken. One time I was watching a video on my dads phone and it showed a video of Alex Morgan running to the ball and her and the goalie had a head collision those types of fouls aren't always fouls. Another time I was watching a video and Alex Morgan Was running and the defender caught her foot on the ankle and down alex Morgan went. Some goals are people jumping and headeing the ball right into the goal. Another goal was some people shit the ball past all the defenders and another player blasted it into the goal. Lastly some records are Pele a famous soccer player scored 1,281 goals in his career. Another record is Hakan Sukur another famous player scored a goal in the first 11 seconds of the game. Also Mia Hamm a famous women soccer player had 158 games in the world games.\n\nConclusion \nAll In all soccer is a great sport. You learned about skills in soccer. You learned about the field and setup on a soccer field. Lastly you learned about Famous fouls, goals and records. Go now and sign up for your local soccer team.

time of WWI and the enemy\u2019s were toos trong, any trench they went in they would be instantly killed so Britain had an idea, they would make heavy armored vehicles, with piercing shells that would tear through any armored vehicles. But there was one problem, they weren't sure how to make powerful shells, and the heaviest armor was too heavy they couldn't move it. It ended up being the mark I with only metal to protect it from gundir They thought it was perfect. It was pretty good then but it only takes a few shots to the weak points (manhole, right/left side) It was called the Little willie Later in WWII the enemy\u2019s figure out what they were doing and beat them to there goal of the piercing shell and heavy armor.\n\nShells\nYou may be confused on why shell is in a book about heavily armored vehicles. Well because that\u2019s the name of the ammunition for tanks. Shells are important parts of tanks because without shells the guns would only fire machine guns that do nothing to other tanks,. The shells had to be perfect for every tank (so it wouldn't blow up while carrying it into the tank) the first shells were actually shotgun shells. Britain wasn\u2019t lazy using shotgun shells for tanks they didn't know that to use it for the shell, and the tanks fire wasn't very powerful so the normal shells now would have just exploded in front of tank. So they ended up with shotgun shells. THen it got more advanced with all the stuff. Also shells are measured in size (mm, cm)\n\nFrom left to right 90 mm shrapnel shell, 120 mm pig iron incendiary shell, 77/14 model 75 mm shrapnel shell. \n\nFacts\n\nLast is facts about tanks. Tanks are very interesting to learn about, mostly on shells, and armor. But facts are the most fun. The word tank was a way to trick germans that were spies and knew english making them think of the \u201cWater Tank\u201d instead of a heavily armed vehicle. Tanks hold 3-5 men, Driver, commander, loader, and gunner, those are mostly there. Then there's the radio man who helps with the radio so that the commander can command while the others work. The radio man helps them keep moving. Next are the tanks in certain wars. World War II: T-34, Tiger, Panzer, Panther, and Sherman. In the Vietnam warL m-48, Merkava, MkIID Baz, Xm1202, T-90, m1a1 abrams, type 10. Artillery vehicles are the best vehicles to counter tanks. \n\nConclusion \n\nDid you know \n", "doctitle": "02_GADGIL_6", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average":

have heard about programming. But have you ever really looked at how programming actually works? Programming is used for multiple things. Like making new apps and softwares or your favorite games if it\u2019s Sea of Thieves or Fortnite. Programing everywhere in technology. And it;s becoming a primary career choice for the 21st century. It;\u2019s even used for things like radios, digital clocks etc. SOme of you will also believe that programing is a useless and life consuming subject. And I understand why you believe that! Although, technology was used for outstanding things like medical uses and wheelchairs! And lots of technology is used for people in the war. In fact, without technology we wouldn\u2019t know anything about our earth! Programming is and important aspect of our society, without it, you wouldn't be reading this right now, and I wouldn't know anything about this subject. You wouldn\u2019t even get to play your favorite games or watch your favorite youtube. And there would be no trends! Oh, thinking about it, that one isn\u2019t that bad\n\nRequirements \nSome people don\u2019t exactly have the tools to be able to make their own software. So I feel it necessary to explain what you\u2019ll need to be able to program. First, any type of programming software. My recommendations are JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, and Python. For this essays sake, let\u2019s use the Python language. To use the python language you have to enter \u201cPython\u201d into the terminal. The software should take a few seconds to take in the information until it\u2019s ready to go. Programing is a very confusing subject even for me. So you\u2019re not going to make a masterpiece like Black Ops II on your first try. \n\n(Subtopic #2)\n\n(Subtopic #3)\n\nConclusion \n\n\n\n\n\n", "doctitle": "02_GADGIL_8", "grades": [{"version": 1,

{"id": 226, "plaintext": "Basketball\n\nI\u2019m going to teach you about basketball. The things i will be telling you are How to play, then famous people that played and last but most important gear!\n\nHow to play basketball well first you need to find a court to play on. Now, let\u2019s start by the points if you make a basket inside of the arch line that counts as 2 points. Behind the arch counts as a 3 point shot. Also if someone fouls you ( foul if someone hits are pushes you in any way) you go to the foul line and take your shots each shot counts as one. If someone fouls you and you make it is an and 1 that means that the red counts the points that you made whether it is a 2 pointer or a 3 pointer and you get 1 shot if the ball goes out of the rectangle line the other person takes that out to pass it it to  the teammate. If you guard someone and people join that is double team that is legal in the ball game. There is a 24 second clock violation which means you have only 24 seconds to shoot the ball unless you get the offensive rebound.\n\nFamous people that/ still play the game of basketball are LeBron James he was a great inspiring player to the NBA  and he still plays he played on the Miami Heat,Cleveland Cavaliers and now he play for my team the Los Angeles Lakers. An also great player is Kobe Bryant  is a great player he was the all time leading scorer in the NBA he played for the Lakers and helped the Lakers to a couple championships unfortunately he retired in 2014. Then comes the three point shooter Stephen Curry is tied for the most threes made at 200. He has led the Golden State Warriors to many championships has won he MVP award 1 time looking for two times.  And actually today is Stephen Curry\u2019s birthday. He is really inspiring to me.\n\nLast but most important is gear to play basketball. 1 thing is basketball shows i recommend you getting Lebron 15 are kyrie 4 they are comfortable. An other thing is shorts if you don\u2019t have basketball shorts you are in big trouble. Also sometimes  your coach gives you your jersey so they Know what number you are. Other things are tights,headband,wristband  arm sleeve and socks. One time I wore a headband and it got so sweaty that i didn\u2019t want to were it anymore. \n\nI hope you enjoyed my writing piece and also you should go give basketball a try i recommend it is really fun!!!", "doctitle": "02_GADGIL_9", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending":

If you want to learn more about Narwhals, then read on. In this essay you will learn about Narwhals habitats, their Diet\\Predators, and threats that could make Narwhals Extinct.\n\nMy first subtopic is about Narwhal habitats. Narwhals usually go threw the cycle of going to Canada to Greenland to Eastern Russia. Primarily, Narwhals stay in the Atlantic ocean (In the Arctic). Narwhals usually spend two months in Arctic ice-free fjords and bays and migrate to overwinter offshore in deep ice-covered habitats.\n\nMy second subtopic is about the diets\\predators of the Narwhal. Narwhals have only two teeth, both in the upper jaw. The left tooth in the upper jaw continues to grow and become a tusk. Tusks are believed to play a part in the breeding competition. Narwhals make deep dives to feed near the bottom, likely using suction to swallow their prey whole. Narwhals eat fish, shrimp, and squid. Narwhal predators are Killer Whales and Polar Bears.\n\nLastly, my third subtopic is about the threats to Narwhals. Narwhals are threatened by hunting. For example, people hunt Narwhals for their ivory. Narwhals are also threatened from climate change. For example, the climate is getting a little bit warmer in the arctic places. Lastly, Narwhals are threatened from industrial activities. For example, some factories that have gas coming out of the top, even though they are thousands of miles apart, the gas could get into the air of a Narwhal and kill it.\n\nAll in all, you have learned a lot about Narwhals. You have learned about the habitats of a Narwhal, the diet\\predators of a Narwhal, and the threats of a Narwhal. I hope that you will research more about Narwhals and become an expert.", "doctitle": "01_Stuck_2", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria":

Futsal is a very cool and unique sport because of ball control, the different rules, and the types of kicks you can do in futsal.\n\nOne reason futsal is a cool and unique sport is all the ball control. One reason you need ball control is your playing on a basketball court. Wikipedia states that on a basketball court you need to have fantastic ball control. Another reason, you need ball control is because there is a lot of players. Ten players is the max of people who should be on the court. But sense your playing on a basketball court with nine other people, it shows you need ball control.\n\nAnother reason futsal is a cool and unique sport is all the different rules. One example of different rules is the general rules. One general rule is there is NO overtime so if the score is zero-zero the referee will end the game. Another, general rule is there is NO offside. If someone is in front of the defence and someone pases to them the referee won\u2019t call it. Another type, of rules is the substitution rules. One, of these rules is the referee will not stop the play for a substitution according to the United States Futsal. One last type, of rules is the restart rules. According to the United States Futsal you kick in the ball where as in soccer you throw in the ball.\n\nAlthough futsal is a cool and unique sport because of ball control, and the different rules, futsal is especially a cool and unique sport because of all the types of kicks you can do. One, type of kick you can do is the sided kick. This kick gives a lot of power if you know how to do it. You can only use this kick in mid-air. And you have to time it perfectly or it won\u2019t work. First, you need to have a time when your going to kick. Next, you swing your foot sideway connecting with the ball. Finally, when you hit the ball push all your power into it and you have a perfect sided kick. Another, type of kick is the Dybala kick. It is very similar to the sided kick but with a few tweeks. First, you knee the ball in mid-air. Then, do a sided kick and you have a perfect Dybala kick.\n\nIn conclusion, futsal is a cool and unique sport because of ball control, different rules and most of all because of all the types of kicks. I think futsal is a great way to improve in soccer (if you even play soccer). Now do you think you would be good at futsal?", "doctitle": "01_Stuck_3", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null,

wonderful. SOmething sweet as heaven, and you feel like your dancing on clouds. This is probably a cupcake your smelling. Not only do cupcakes smell good, but also there are many flavors, you can decorate them however you want and there easy to make!\n\nFlavores\nWhenever I go to the cupcake shop and I just can\u2019t decide which cupcake to get! There are so many flavors! All of them are good too. Chocolate is always a nice one to pick. How about vanilla bean? Lemon? There are so many cake/frosting combos too! Lemon cake and vanilla frosting, or the other way around. Chocolate cake and vanilla frosting. Chocolate cake and chocolate frosting. Vanilla cake and vanilla frosting. that\u2019s called vanilla bean! Blueberry frosting, mmmmmmmmmm! Strawberry cake? Why not! Sounds good to me! Just writing this paragraph made my mouth water!\n\nDecorating\nNow that you know all of the flavors and have chosen yours out, it\u2019s time to get whatever decorations you want! There are two types of decorations. One is edible, and the other is non-edible. (Edible means you can eat it without being sick! So non-edible is the opposite!) Lions. Let\u2019s start with non-edible decorations. Sometimes cupcakes will have little plastic toys or candles on them. Normally if it has candes it means that there\u2019s a celebration of some sort. (Birthday, wedding, anniversary etc:) Edible decorations are also on all of those things too. Sprinkles, candy beads, extra decorative frosting, edible glitter, there are just so many! The rapper is most important (probably). If you are going to use a cupcake wrapper, choose wisely! There are so many different designs on them. In conclusion, cupcakes have many ways to decorate.\n\nLet\u2019s make a cupcake!\nNow let\u2019s get down to business. When making a cupcake make sure you have and adult supervision because you will be dealing with hot surfaces and no one wants to get hurt, right? First, you need all your wet ingredients. Eggs, Milk, butter, and everything else that is a \u201cwet ingredient\u201d, put them all in a bowl and put it under a mixer until all of the bubbles and clumps are gone. (You may also use your hands (a whisk) for mixing.) next, grab all of your dry ingredients. Flour, sugar, baking soda, and everything else that is a \u201cdry ingredient\u201d. Do the same but putting it in a bowl and putting the bowl under the mixer until all of the bubbles and clumps are gone. After that, combined all of they ingredients and put them in one big bowl and put that under the mixer. (See above) Then, put the batter into a cupcake tin and make sure it\u2019s all evenly spread out. Put that in the oven for however long the resipy says. (Different cakes bake for different times!) after you hear the heavenly ding of the wonderful pastre, take they out, pup them out, and decorate! (See second paragraph.) Finally, you can eat your sweet treat! Save me one too!\n\nConclusion\nAfter all of that I think if I don\u2019t get a cupcake i\u2019m going to explode! After all, cupcakes come in a wide range of flavors, can be decorated any way you want, and are easy to make.

Additionally, Pandas eat up to 27 pounds each day,There are many ways why pandas are going excited , but don\u2019t just sit there,  you can help pandas from going extinct. \n\nBamboo is  99 percent of panda\u2019s diet because they also eat small rodents and leaves. 160,000 sq kilometers of bamboo is getting cut down each year. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating and spend up to 10 to 16 hours sleeping. \n\nAccording to What do pandas eat? WWF \u201cBamboo contains very little nutritional value, so pandas must eat 12-38 kg every day to meet their energy needs.\u201d\n\nHow are Pandas Endangered?\n\nPandas are endangered Because their food is get cut down for wood use. Additionally, there food is theirhabitat so they have nowhere to live. According to endangered-no-more-giant-pandas \u201cGiant pandas first become endangered in 1990 due to excessiive poaching in the 80s and deforestation, depleting their bamboo food source.\n\nHow you can Help\n\nThere are many ways you help pandas For example, help at Panda rescue center, Protect bamboo for going extinct, tell people to not cut down bamboo. So help bamboo and pandas from going extinct.Protect the forest for where he pandas live. \n\nHelp pandas from going extinct .

The seafloor and some mountains were formed by countless volcanic eruptions. Gaseous emissions from volcano formed the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u201d (dosomething.org) The Ring of Fire contains many volcanes, there are also many different types of volcanoes, some more dangerous than others. Volcanoes form in three different ways. \n\nThe ring of fire contains 72% of all of the world\u2019s active volcanoes. Also, the Ring of Fire is 24,900 miles all around it. The Ring of Fire has 452 volcanoes around it. The Ring of Fire contains 15 countries along it. \u201cThe abundance of volcanoes and earthquakes along the Ring of Fire is caused by the amount of movement of tectonic plates in the area.\u201d (National Geographic)\n\nThe three main types of volcanoes are, composites, shields, and lava domes. Composite volcanoes are 8,000 foot domes that are filled with lava and magma. Shield volcanoes are the largest volcanoes on earth and are also filled with lava and magma. Finally, lava domes are formed by magma that can not go away or move very far. \n\nMount Vesuvius, Mount Rainier, Novarupta, Mount Pinturbo, Mount St. Helens, Mount Agung,and Mount Fuji are the most dangerous volcanoes. \n\nMount Vesuvius is a well known volcano in the town of Pompeii. Novarupta Eruption was the most powerful eruption in the 201th century. Mount Rainier\u2019s most recent eruption killed around 23,000 people but, erupted in 1894. Mount Pinaturbo killed 722 total people(witch is still a lot!) \u201cOn May 18, 1980, an earthquake struck below the north face of Mount St. Helens in Washington state, triggering the largest landslide in recorded history and a major volcanic eruption that scattered ash across a dozen states.\u201d (The Atlantic) \u201cAgung\u2019s euption lasted 11 months, producing dangerous ash fall and pyroclastic flows that led to more than 1,000 deaths and property damage.\u201d (Time) If Mt. Fuji ever erupts agani, it\u2019ll affect 25,000,000 people(death, sicknesses, ect.)!\n\n\u201cVolcanoes can be formed in three ways. Theses include inter-plate activity, where magma pushes up between cracks in tectonic plate boundaries; the drift of hotspots in continental plates, which pushes magma through the surface; and magma chambers opening up beneath the earth, which cracks the surface of forms volcanoes.\u201d (Referece.com).

this gaming PC because it has intel core, AMD FX 6200 processor, and lots of other things that will make you look like a gamer and your gaming setup look like a true gaming setup this gaming setup runs like a real gaming setup. also it is accessible for VR such as vive VR and Oculus VR. also this gaming PC doesn\u2019t just run good it also looks how a gaming PC should look like. my favorite thing is that instead of plastic on the one side of the PC its glass so you can see the inside of the PC. also in the inside of the PC there are LED gaming lights. and that\u2019s why i think you

Wolves have many characteristics. They also have an unusual diet. \n\nCommunication\n\nFirst off all wolves communicate through body language, scent marking, barking, and howling. Wolves/Dogs may howl because another wolf is howling, and it can be heard from 10 miles away. When a wolf backs down from another wolf it will couch, whimper, tuck in its tail, lick the other wolf\u2019s mouth or roll over on its back and when a wolf is going to fight it puts his ears back on his head and growls to warn others to stay away. Barking is used as a warning to others and howling is a way to communicate and gather their pack together. \n\nAnother way wolves communicate is through body language.\nWhen a wolf wants to play, it prances about happily and bows-lowering the front of its body while its butt stays up in the air with its tail wagging. When it\u2019s angry, a wolf may frown its forehead, show its fangs, or growl.\n\nCharacteristics of a wolf\nSecond of all A wolf\u2019s sense of smell is 100 times stronger than a human\u2019s. A pack is a family of 7-8 wolves with a mom, dad, and baby wolves. Each pack has a different and unique howl. Canines with long bushy tails that are often black-tipped. Ther coat color is typically a mix of gray and brown. Wolves vary in size depending on where they live. The average size of a wolf\u2019s body is three to five feet long and their tails are usually one to two feet long. Females typically weigh 60 to 100 pounds, and Females typically weigh 60 to 100 pounds, and males weigh 70 to 145 pounds.\n\nWolves also eat smaller mammals, birds, fish, lizards, snakes, and fruit. They attack their prey in packs while surrounding it. Adult wolves care for their young pups and bring them food when they are hungry. They keep and eye on the young pups while other wolves are hunting. Wolves are Carnivores and they prefer to eat large hoofed mammals such as deer, elk bison, and moose.
