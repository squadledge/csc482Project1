There is a kid size basketball and a professional size. You also need basketball hoops to shoot in. One time I was play basketball in my reguer shoes and when the game was over, the bottoms were practically worn off. \n\nYou need a place to play basketball. You can practically play basketball anywhere as long as you have a hoop to shoot in. The best place to play is inside on a wood floor because a wood floor is better for basketball. Also if it\u2019s raining you don\u2019t want to be outside playing basketball, right? In the summer though its nice out so you should play outside. So the best place to play when its raining is inside.\n\nThere are alot of famous basketball players and good teams. Michael jordan was a really good basketball player that played on the bulls.

Tarsiers bodys are equipped with a long tail and strong hands.They are carnivores and eat mainly insects. Tarsiers have to stay in trees so their predators don't get them. Their habitats are in the trees of great rainforests and their lives depend on staying away from other creatures. Read this book and you will learn how to save these lovable creatures.\n\n\tThe tarsier is an arboreal nocturnal primate with a stocky body and long tail that is either sparsely covered in fur or has a tuft at the end. They have long and strong hind legs to jump from distances up to 5 meters. The tarsiers eyes are big for catching the little light that they see in the night. The Tarsiers have either have grey, brown, or ochre colored fur depending on the species of the tarsier. There are 13 different types of tarsier but they all have the long tail to cling to something. The hand and feet both have grippy spots on the face of their fingers. The hand has  fingers but, it doesn\u2019t have a thumb.\n\n\tTarsiers diet is made up of mostly insects, but they also eat birds, bats, lizards, and snakes. The tarsier will get it\u2019s prey by jumping on it. The tarsier has to be very patient for its prey. Tarsiers are carnivores and hunt in the trees. The tarsier grabs its prey with its strong hands and holds the prey really tight. Then the tarsier will bite the animal with its forceful jaws.\n\n\tThe tarsier has many predators, but the main predators are civets, arboreal snakes, and monitor lizards. Humans are also big threat to tarsiers because humans are choppping homes of tarsiers down and pulling them in to zoos. Humans also poach tarsiers because of their fur. These threats are killing the species of tarsiers. There is an estimate that are only 5,000 and 10,000 philippine Tarsiers left in the whole world and that number is going down.\n\n\tTarsiers live in South East Asia, Borneo, Sumatra, Bangka, Beitung, Kalimata, and other surrounding islands. The tarsiers live in the trees but sometimes a tarsier will fall to the ground and break a bone. Then a predator can get them. The trees keep them hidden from predators.Tarsiers can sometimes be found in villages close to rain forests too.\n\n\tHelp save these amazing creatures from extinction. As you can see the tarsiers are amazing little creatures that need to be protected. The tarsiers are keeping the amount of animals in the same spot.

Chinchillas are small South American rodents with soft gray fur and a long bushy tail. They do a little something for the environment, but are being killed by humans every day, and they have many natural threats as well, however you can help protect these adorable animals from extinction.\n\nWhat Chinchillas do for the Environment\n\n\tChinchillas don't do much for the planet but what they do do makes a difference. Sometimes they live in high altitudes and in high altitudes they have very thick fur to keep them warm in the winter. Seeds get stuck in their fur and they distribute the seeds to all the places that they go because the seeds fall off of them, then plants from different places will grow all over where they go. \n\nChinchillas Are Threatened by Humans\n\n\tOne reason chinchillas are being killed by humans is because chinchilla fur is considered the softest fur in the world. Chinchilla coats are also very beautiful. They are striped and almost metallic. Finally chinchilla coats can cost $1,000 - $5,000 dollars.\n\nChinchillas and Their Natural Predators\n\n\tIn addition to people killing them, chinchillas have many natural predators as well. Some of these predators include; skunks, felines, canines, and snakes, as well as and most birds of prey. One of the reasons why chinchillas have so many predators is because they are small and easy to catch. Chinchillas have an amazing technique that helps them not get eaten or killed. They do this by dis-attaching part of their fur so that they can try to make a quick escape. The fur that they lose will grow back eventually. \n\nHow We Can Save the Chinchillas\n\n\tThere are many ways and websites to help save the wild chinchillas. For example, volunteermatch.org is a great website to help. Another website that is very helpful to the furry creatures is save the wild chinchillas.org. Finally, you can go to your local pet store like petco and buy a chinchilla. The prices range from $150-$350 dollars. Even though they are pretty expensive just know that you are saving the little cuddly animals life.\n\n\tChinchillas help the environment but humans are killing them. They are also being killed by their natural predators in the wild but there are many different ways we can help save these furry little creatures.", "doctitle": "04_Maramba_4", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": null, "lead": null, "transitions": null, "ending": null, "organization": null, "elaboration": null, "craft": null, "spelling": null, "punctuation": null, "grammar": null}}, "markup": [], "checkboxes": {"checked": [], "unchecked": ["0-0_grammar", "0-0_punctuation", "0-0_spelling", "0-1_grammar", "0-1_punctuation", "0-1_spelling", "0-2_grammar", "0-2_punctuation", "0-2_spelling", "0-3_grammar", "0-3_punctuation", "0-3_spelling", "0-4_grammar", "0-4_punctuation", "0-4_spelling", "0-5_grammar", "0-5_punctuation", "0-6_grammar", "0-6_punctuation", "0-7_grammar", "2-0_craft", "2-0_elaboration", "2-0_ending", "2-0_lead", "2-0_organization", "2-0_overall", "2-0_transitions", "3-0_craft", "3-0_elaboration", "3-0_ending", "3-0_lead", "3-0_organization", "3-0_overall", "3-0_transitions", "3-1_craft", "3-1_organization", "3-1_overall", "3-1_transitions", "3-2_craft", "3-2_organization", "3-3_organization", "4-0_craft", "4-0_elaboration", "4-0_ending", "4-0_lead", "4-0_organization", "4-0_overall", "4-0_transitions", "4-1_craft", "4-1_elaboration", "4-1_ending", "4-1_lead", "4-1_organization", "4-1_overall", "4-1_transitions", "4-2_craft", "4-2_elaboration", "4-2_organization", "4-2_transitions", "4-3_craft", "4-3_elaboration", "4-4_craft", "4-4_elaboration", "4-5_craft", "4-5_elaboration", "5-0_craft", "5-0_elaboration", "5-0_ending", "5-0_lead", "5-0_organization", "5-0_overall", "5-0_transitions", "5-1_craft", "5-1_elaboration", "5-1_lead", "5-1_organization", "5-1_overall", "5-1_transitions", "5-2_craft", "5-2_elaboration", "5-2_organization", "5-2_transitions", "5-3_craft", "5-3_elaboration", "5-3_transitions", "5-4_craft", "5-4_elaboration", "5-5_craft", "5-5_elaboration", "5-6_elaboration"]}}, {"version": 2, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 34.5, "average": 2.88, "criteria": {"overall": 3.0, "lead": 4.0, "transitions": 3.0, "ending": 2.5, "organization": 4.0, "elaboration": 3.0, "craft": 3.0, "spelling": 4.0, "punctuation": 2.0, "grammar": null}, "comments": {"overall": "", "lead": "", "transitions": "", "ending": "", "organization": "", "elaboration": "adding twin sentences as support would help", "craft": "", "spelling": "", "punctuation": "", "grammar": ""}}, "markup": [{"start_index": 296, "end_index": 312, "old_text": "as well, however", "new_text": "as well.

Well the cause of all this is climate change. Climate change is earth's temperature rising which creates problems with the environment. For example, in 2040 the Arctic may have it's completely ice free summer. Which means that animals will die out. For instance, polar bears will come extinct with no ice. Climate change will make things become extinct, it has many bad effects, it is caused by us, and you can stop it.\n\nThings That Will Become Extinct With Climate Change\n\n\tDid you know that the Bramble Cay melomys have already become extinct because of climate change? The Kolah is one of the animals at risk of extinction. And if Koalas go extinct, it will destroy plants that are vital for other species. The ringed seal may also go extinct, and so may the leatherback and the Hawksbill sea turtle. And, if sea turtles go extinct, any animals that survive on healthy seagrass beds, or coral reefs will go extinct. The Arctic fox may also go extinct. If they go extinct, many animals will overpopulate. In 2050 there are many animals that will go extinct if we don't do something. They include, Orangutans, Lemurs, Rhinos, Polar bears, Gorillas, Vaquitas, and Cheetahs. Lemurs have been around for 7 million years! That makes them the longest living mammal on the entire planet! If you like honey, you'll definitely want to stop climate change if you know this. Another animal that will become extinct is, the Rusty Patched bumble Bee! The Rusty Patched bumble Bee population has decreased 87%! And, Bees have existed on planet earth for 40 million years! Also, it's not just animals that will become extinct, plants will become extinct as well. This will happen when animals become extinct, other animals will overpopulate. If these animals that overpopulate are herbivores, then plants will become extinct because of all of the animals eating them.\nIn summary, because of climate change, many things will become extinct.\n\nThe Bad Effects of Climate Change\n\n\tDid you know that if climate change keeps up, hurricanes will stronger, and more intense. Also, the sea level will rise one to four feet by 2100. Also, if you in Jakarta Indonesia, Bangkok Thailand, Lagos Nigeria, Manila Philippines, Dhaka Bangladesh Shanghai, China, London England, or Houston Texas your town will be engulfed by the ocean in about 2100. Additionally, the arctic will become ice free. To add on, climate change also affects our food. Since climate change is earth's temperature rising, it will make it rain less, which means that plants will be missing out on water, and they won't be able to grow. To add on, climate change could also affect our health. For example, the air quality will be worse. Also, lots of animals and plants have to migrate to different, cooler areas of the world. \"Some species -- including mosquitoes, ticks, jellyfish, and crop pests -- are thriving. Booming populations of bark beetles that feed on spruce and pine trees, for example, have devastated milllions of forested areas in the U.S.\" Said National Geographic, Effects of Climate Change. As well as, many diseases will spread. For example, malaria.\nIn summary, climate change has many bad effects.\n\nHow Does Climate Change Happen\n\n\t\"Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping,\" Said The Causes of Climate Change. If this happens, the earth will automatically warm up if the heat cannot escape. It will just be trapped not being able to get out. This is called the greenhouse effect. Some of the greenhouse gasses are, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Water Vapor, and Nitrous Oxide. \"Humans are burning fossil fuels, releasing huge amounts of carbon pollution and trapping more and more heat in the atmosphere.\" Said How Do we Know Humans are Causing Climate Change. Planet earth's temperature depends on how much energy leaving the planet. \"When incoming energy from the sun is absorbed by the Earth system, Earth warms.\" Said Causes of Climate Change.\nIn summary,\nClimate change happens in different ways.\n\nHow To Stop Climate Change\n\n\tDid you know that you could help stop climate change just by riding a bike, taking public transportation, or carpooling? You could also help stop climate change by using renewable energy. If you can do anything to stop climate change, you should do it. For if you don't, many, many things will go wrong. Also, to help stop climate change you could buy an energy efficient car, or get a green career. For example, you could help make solar panels. \"Any electronic gadget you can turn on with a remote (TV, DVD player, Nintendo, Xbox) uses power even when it is \"off.\" Appliances with a digital clock (like a coffee maker) or a power adapter (like a laptop computer) also suck power like a sneaky vampire.\" Said Climate Kids.\nIn summary,\nYou should help stop climate change.\n\n\tDid you know that in 1950, \"CO2 levels broke records from the previous 400,000 years, sharply rising and continuing to grow?\"\nIn summary,\nClimate change will make things become extinct, it has many bad effects, it is caused by us, and you can stop it.", "doctitle": "04_Maramba_3", "grades": [{"version": 1, "comment": "", "score": {"total": 0.0, "average": 0.0, "criteria": {"overall": null, "lead":

"Introduction\nDid you know that Simon Cowell is a producer of America\u2019s got Talent? Simon Cowell is a very important person to the performance history he has done many things to make performing shows on TV better. Today I am going to teach you about Simon\u2019s family, Simon\u2019s jobs, and Simon\u2019s fame.\n\nSimon\u2019s Family\nIn Simon Cowell\u2019s life he had a big family. Simon Phillip Cowell was born on October 7, 1959. Right now, Simon is 59 years old. Simon was born in London UK. Simon\u2019s mom\u2019s name is Juliet and his dad\u2019s name is Eric. Also, Simon has two sisters, June and Lindsay. Not only that but Simon has a lot of brothers. Some of his brothers include Michel, John, and Nicholas. Simon also has a half brother named Tony. Simon\u2019s wife is named Lauren Silverman and his son is named Eric. Nowadays Simon doesn\u2019t really get together with his brothers and sisters but every once in a while he does. As you can see Simon has a big family, if you think about it you actually might want to be in a family as big as his, maybe.\n\nSimons Jobs\nSimon has had many jobs over the years. The main job Simon has now is a judge and producer on AGT (America\u2019s got Talent.) Not only is Simon a judge and a producer on AGT but he was an actor, music producer, film producer, and much, much more. Simon was bored of being a music producer so he started all the got talents to hear more than just music, but a variety of acts. Simon didn\u2019t start AGT as the first got talent because by then he didn\u2019t live in America, he lived in England. The first got talent was BGT (Britain\u2019s got Talent) where Simon lived. Simon started BGT in 2007.\n\nSimon\u2019s Fame\nWould you like to live a normal life, or a life like Simon Cowell\u2019s? If you lived a life like Simon Cowell you would be on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. You would get $950,000 dollars a year. Oh wait! Did I say $950,000, sorry, I meant $95,000,000. Simon Cowell has around $550,000,000 right now. If you had money like that you could buy almost anything you wanted. You could buy a huge house like Simon\u2019s. You could buy a swimming pool like Simon. You could buy so many things if you had money like Simon. Another thing is, Simon gets paid $25,000 everytime he gets a paycheck on AGT.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all Simon Cowell is a very important part of history in many ways. Now that you know about Simon\u2019s family, jobs, and fame you should do more research on his life style a stuff like that. If you\u2019re wondering like me if Juliet is Simon\u2019s mom or stepmom you should find out yourself. If you lived a life like Simon Cowell, you will live a long happy life, or as Simon would say on AGt \u201cI don\u2019t like it, I love it!\u201d", "doctitle": "04_Andre_3", "grades": [{"version": 1,
