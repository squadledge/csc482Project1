    "plaintext": "Did you know that the fastest nitro funny car record is 337.66 mph? Nitro funny cars are super powerful because they have nitro in the tank, because they have 10,000 horsepower, and most of all because they have brave drivers.\n\nOne reason Nitro funny cars are super powerful is that they have the biggest engine out of any car. Even though they are scary looking, they are the best and fastest motorsport in the world. Also they have a 10,000 horsepower engine which is insane to think about. To add on they have changed overtime the engines have made way more horsepower, they have way different speeds and horsepower.\n\nAnother reason Nitro funny cars are super powerful is that they have 10 to 11,000 horsepower. Continuously, they are SO loud they can shake you anywhere you are they're so powerful. Also did you know that the fastest nitro funny car run was shattered by robert hight at 337.66 MPH! According to google search. My second evidence for that is they are the fastest thing on the planet that's how fast they even are. To add on those cars can pull a 4 to 5 g-force which is big on your body. My third evidence for that is drag racing is scary and exciting to watch. Drag racing is scary, awesome, and frightening at the same time.\n\nAlthough nitro funny cars are super powerful because they have massive motors and because they run on two of the fastest fuels especially nitro funny cars are super powerful because the tires they have are super grippy. To begin with, the 2 fuels they run on are either aucohaule, or nitromethane. My second evidence for that is i learn alot from my grandpa because he raced in his career, so i learn alot from him In conclusion nitro funny cars are super powerful because they have the fastest accelerating engine on earth, they have huge motors, and most of all, because they have 10,000 horsepower. I think that nitro funny cars are the best funny car out of the two because the other one the regular funny car has the two main fuels. The question leaving you guys thinking about is: would you go out to a drag race and have your body being shook by those engines? Also having to wear ear muffs to keep your ear drums from being blown out by the sounds, and looking at the flames coming from the exhaust pipes, and being frightened by the engine exploding and swerving all over the track?",

    "plaintext": "All About My Mom\n\nIntroduction\n\tDo you love your mom? I hope so! I love my mom because she does stuff for me like help me with things I can't do I my own, taking care of me, and encouraging me to do things that I don't feel certain about. Why should you continue reading? You should keep reading because you might relate to something I wrote and you know that you're not the only one with those thoughts.\n\nHelpful\n\tDoes your mom help you when you're stuck on a math problem? My mom does, well, sometimes. My mom helps me with things that I can't do by myself. An example for this is when she helps me on homework. She does this by teaching me what it's asking me and shows me things that I didn't know how to do before. That's not the only reason my mom is helpful, she also makes sure I'm okay like when I'm going on a care trip. When I'm going on a long car ride she usually gives me pills to help me not get sick. One example for this is when she opens a water bottle for me when I can't. I know that might not seem like a lot, but I probably wouldn;t be able to open the water bottle without her help. And lastly, another example is when we're out somewhere and something is happening. I'm usually too short to see, so my mom carries me up so I can.\n\nCaring\n\tWhat does your mom do that's caring to you? My mom is caring to me by helping me take care of my tortoise, helping me with gardening, and giving me as much of her love as she can to me and my brother. Sometimes I can't do certain things to take care of my tortoise so my mom helps me with them. My mom feeds him everyday in the morning right after she drops me up from school. And she also takes him out in the garden when I can't, everyday. My mom also helps me with gardening. She does this by helping me not get too messy when by the soil. That may not seem that caring but it's actually a hard job. I'm a clumsy person and get messy easily so her help is very appreciated. And last of all, my mom is caring becase she\n\nEncouraging\n\tWhat things does your mom encourage you about?\n\n\nConclusion\n\tNow you hopefully know about how much my mom takes care of me, how encouraging she ism how helpful she is to me, and how amazing she is. But before you leave, I want to explain how I felt writing this. Do you usually get to spent time with your mom? Well I'm one of the many that do. Writing this made me realize that there was a lot of kids that don't though. And that made me think about how lucky I was and am to get to spend the amount of time that I do with my mom, and made me appreciate the things she does for me a little more. So if you do get to spend time with your mom, go tell her how grateful you are for what she does. But if you don't get to spend that much time with your mom, you should still thank her for getting to spend time with her at all, she'll really appreciate it. \n",

You wil learn about the gray wolf therediet, the pack, there behavior,\n\nAbout the gray wolf\n\nGray wolves are the largest of the dog family. Adaptable gray wolves are the most common and once lived in the northern hemisphere. Humans and wolves have a long history together and although they almost never attack humans they are considered on of the animal worlds most fearsome predators. Over the years countless wolves have been shot, trapped, and poisoned because they are so ferocious.\n\nThere diet\n\nGray wolves prefer to eat big animals like deer.carib), elk, and moose and wolves eat smaller animals like lizards, fish, birds, snakes,\nand fruit, and they are scavengers. A single wolf can consume 20 pounds of meat in a sitting.\n\n\nMeet the pack\n\nIn a wolf pack there is a male leader and his mate is close behind and then there are mother and father wolf ( called the alphas ) the alpha female and alpha male are also the ones that hunt the food, mark the territory, and chos den sites. Wolves can develop\nstrong bonds within there packs \n\nreproduction\n\nBreeding season occurs once a year, late January through March. Wolf pups are born blind and deafness. The pack cares for them until they are about ten months of age when they can hunt by themselves.. When the wolves are fully matured they might disperse. When they disperse they could travel 50-500 miles.\n",

    "plaintext": "How to setup a Xbox 1\nBy Christian\n\nTable of Contents\n# 1:How to reset a Xbox 1 controller\n# 2: How much is a Xbox 1\n# 3: How to download games\n\nIntroduction\nDo you have a Xbox one? Well if you do but do not know how to reset a xbox controller, and how to download apps, and how much is a xbox? Then read my book. I will teach you how to setup a xbox controller, how much is a xbox one, and finally how to download games and apps.\n\nHow to reset a Xbox 1 controller\nHello my name is Christian and now I will teach you how to reset a xbox one controller. Ok frist you need to turn on your Xbox. Second of all you need to hold down the Xbox button. Not on your controller but on the actual Xbox. Hold it down for at least ten seconds. Now your screen has gone black. Do not panic because that is part of the process. Now wate for at least 30 seconds. Then turn back on your Xbox 1. Now you have reset your Xbox one controller. So not you can show your friends how to reset your xbox 1.\n\nHow much is a Xbox 1\nHow I have taught you how to reset a xbox controller. But we are not done yet. Now I am going to tell you how much a xbox is. I am also going to tell you how much a xbox controller is and how much the games are and also how much the headset is so you can play with your friends online. So the xbox is about three hundred to four hundred dollars. The xbox controllers are about fifty six dollars and I would get another controller so your friends can play on your xbox with you. The headset is about thirty dollars. And for each game is about eighteen dollars each.\n\nHow to download apps on your Xbox 1\nI am almost done telling you how to setup an Xbox one. Now I just need to tell you how to download apps. So last chapter how much is a xbox I told you how much games are But you can\u2019t get all games on disc. Some games you have to get on the xbox app store. Like fortnite, Roblox, Overwatch, Minecraft, star wars battlefront, and way more games on the xbox app store. But if you don\u2019t know how to download games then listen up because I\u2019m the new teacher around these parts. So first go to microsoft on your xbox. Then you see that bar at the top that says search. Click on that bar and type in the name of the game that you want. Then your cover with the title will pop up. Click on the game the game picture and then this is when your moms debit card comes in handy. Select the right credit card. And then hit buy. Now you have that game downloaded. Have fun playing your new game.\n\nConclusion.\nHave I hooked you? Well if I didn\u2019t did I mention that if you hit that xbox button on your controller and you will see all these games that you have recently played. If you click on that game then it will take you back to that game. So that is how you switch games faster. Well see ya. WATE! I just wanted to tell you. Have a fun time on your new Xbox.",
